5,Very powerful booster that is well made.,2020/12/14,Jumped off a 4.7 Durango that has been sitting for six months with a battery at zero volts twice with no struggle at all. Honestly it sounded like it was cranking from a new battery and a booster. Better yet it only showed a ten percent drop in power battery power. The clamps are sturdy and the cables while short are of heavier gauge wire than allot of others. This is a good thing since that means less resistance. The included charger is well constructed as well. Bother the charger and the USB c cable that come with it have Velcro ties seem to them to make storage neat and easy. The worklight while not insanely bright is just about a perfect amount of light to illuminate a wide area for work while not blinding you. All in all this is one impressive jump starter that will see allot of use at work and at home. In an Auto tech and Jane used a great number of boosters from smaller units like this to massive dual deep cycle units and this will be my go to every time.
1,Will update when number provided correct.,2020/12/14,Support phone number will not accept incoming calls why provide one. See pic.
5,Hulkman is by far the BEST Jump Starter Unit on the Market,2020/12/19," So many uses but by far the Best Automotive Jump Starter Unit on the market. Connect the Jumper leads to the unit, connect leafs to correct colored battery posts, turn unit on, wait for green light, then turn on vehicle. I can charge my Samsung Note 20 Ultra more than 5 times from critical low 5% to 100%. I got almost 7 1/2 charges from 15% to 20%. The unit auto shut off when left on for a certain period of time. Sturdy design with built in Led Flashlight, red flashing lights, and a LED Battery Percentage Display. All this at an affordable price..."
5,Great Roll-Out,2020/12/28," A-lot of thought went into this product right down to the accessories that are included. Item arrived with a 68% charge and 24 minutes later after being plugged into household power it was at 100% Simple and easy to use. Contacted customer service with a couple of basic questions, they were answered within the same day. Will have to see on its longevity. Down side is that it does not come with any type of case or bag. With that said after trial and error the following case worked great for me... Aproca Hard Storage Travel Case for BESTEK 500W Power Inverter/NOCO Genius G1100 Battery Charger."
4,Can't get a hold of the manufacturer,2021/2/1,The charger worked great for the first couple of weeks and then it stopped charging.  Getting a hold of the manufacturer for repair or replacement is next to impossible.  Been trying to get in touch with them for about 3 weeks.  Bought another charger from a different manufacturer but I don't like it as much as the Hulkman.  Wish there was a way to get in touch with them.  I posted this a couple of days ago and and the manufacturer responded by replacing my charger at no cost.  I appreciate their response to this.
4,Great product!,2021/2/3,"This is a well designed emergency jump starter, especially for a first-generation product. So far I would recomend it--time will tell.We bought the 1st Generation model WITHOUT self heating option for $99.00 in Feb. 2021.  The 2nd Generation self heating model for $199.00 is designed primarily for very cold locations. Our southern climate & the hand warmers we keep in our cars during winter allows the less expensive model to meet our needs.Nothing about this slim quick charger seems cheap or flimsy.  It appears to be well built and should lasts 5 years or more years with proper care (crossing fingers).NOTE: We used the Hulkman 8.5 the day it was delivered.  One car had a bad battery so I read the instructions, charged the unit to 100% ( took about 22 minutes with the included wall charger), hooked it up to the car battery and turned it on.  The nice HUGE DISPLAY (pay attention all of you with glasses or over 50! ) showed a ""fully drained battery"" so I turned it off, then back on in ""Override mode"" by depressing both buttons simultaniously.  The display quickly drained from 100% down to 79% charge & the green ""Ready"" light came on.  The car started right up.My first thoughts were:  ""Wow!!!  This sure beats dragging around heavy jumper cables/the old heavy Lead acid based chargers & scratching the paint!""  It was faster too.  In less than 3 minutes our car was running and ready to drive from a completely dead battery (not even the door lights worked).  Modern technology is great!Way to go Hulkman Team--keep up the good work!"
5,DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THINGS THAT WORK?!!!,2021/2/21,"About an hour ago, I received my Hulkman Alpha85 and had to write this review.  Here's my story.I have 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis.  I do not drive it much and definitely do not drive it during the winter, preferring, instead, to use my smaller, more gas efficient car.  But, I love my Grand Marquis and have taken good care of it over the years.  However, a few days ago, I went out to the garage to crank the engine over and take the car for a brief spin.  The battery had other ideas.So, I got out my jumper cables and proceeded to jump the Grand Marquis, as I have done in the past.  That did not work.  I decided to look at Amazon to see if there might be a solution.  There was a lot of good talk about the Hulkman Alpha85, so I made the purchase.Last night the temperatures got down to 18 degrees.  Pretty cold.When I received the Alpha85, the charge was at 75%.  I plugged it into the house outlet, and it was charged to 100% in eight minutes, according to my stop watch...yes, I put my stop watch on to see how fast it would charge.  Now, with a charge of 100%, I headed out to the Grand Marquis.At this time, the temperature outside was at 36 degrees.I attached the negative to the negative and then the positive to the positive.  It took 1-2 seconds before the READY light came on.  I got into the car, turned the ignition, and the car started immediately.  Zero hesitation.For well over 20 years, I have been purchasing items from Amazon.  Most purchases are fine.  Some...not so fine.  But, when I get a product like this Hulkman Alpha85, that worked so well for me, I really felt compelled to write a review promptly.  The folks at Hulkman seem to know what they are doing.  I am grateful for their determination to produce a product that actually does what it says it does.I highly endorse this product."
5,Goodbye jumper cables!!,2021/2/23,"The days of looking for jumper cables, then another car to jumpstart your car have ended.  I recently had a chance to use the Hulkman for the first time, and it worked perfectly.  Car was started in minutes without having to find the cables from last year, then find which side the battery was on for both cars before trying to remember which side gets the red cable, which gets the black & which are only gets the red cable.  Simple pop the hood, attach the Hulkman cables and start the car...you're done and on your way.  If you are in an cold climate and experience at least one dead battery a year, then you will be glad to have the Hulkman!!"
3,Dead Battery Jump Start Experience,2021/3/7,"I bought this product a few weeks ago not expecting to use it anytime soon. That said, today my wife's 2018 SUV with a 4.6L V8 wouldn't start, so we took the Hulkman out of my car and tried it out (we were thankfully at home).

While the car issue was later isolated to a loose negative battery terminal (later reinstalling my 'dead' battery fully resolved the issue...negative connection was very loose), we used the override mode designed for dead/no battery. The product was powering something and discharging (I could hear some pre-startup engine bay noises), but I was disappointed with claims indicating this product would start cars with no battery. Despite ideal conditions (70F outside, Hulkman 90% charged), and despite tries both positive-to-frame (with battery) and later positive-to-negative (car battery removed), the Hulkman 85 in no way starts our V8 SUV with no battery.

That said, I still give it 3 stars for now. Why? Using it was superior to our other jump starter, which had mostly discharged and was much more confusing to operate. The Hulkman's screen adds a ton of confidence to the jump starting process -- it is easy to see exact charging level, easy to see error code ""2"" (that a dead battery override would be needed), and easy to see ready state and discharging to the car. It was helpful that the directions are printed permanently on the back of the product, and it was easy to see when it became overheated due to too many tries. It's pretty big, but it also works fine for phone/iPad USB charging. Charging it in less than an hour is excellent.

Note that override mode will turn off after about 30sec, after which you can override again to try once more. I do wonder modern car software boot up somehow made it more difficult due to start the car, but that said, no luck, so I'll never know.

So, it still seems like a decent enough product, and maybe it will start a low battery or my 2.0L 4 cylinder, but it would need a lot more beef to be bulletproof with our V8 with no battery."
1,Does not work very bad quality,2021/3/22,Stay away only worked 3 times and gave up
5,The perfect jump starter,2021/3/26,"I had a dinky old Napa Blue jump starter lying around that decided to get real puffy on me. And as everyone probably knows, once your Lithium Ion Battery starts to swell, it’s to get rid of it. That said I was looking for a couple of features in a new battery and this one fit the bill perfectly.

1. Battery should last a really long time just sitting around: The Hulkman accomplishes this. Where it truly shines however is the 65W USB-C charging. I can leave this thing hooked up to a type C charger in my glove compartment and forget about it. And it’s ready to go when I need it.

2. Able to start large engines: While my car has a 2.0 Flat 4 FA-20 motor. I wanted something that could fire up a V8 if necessary. Because my friends have larger engines.

3. USB-C two way charging. I really wanted a battery that supported two way USB-C PD so I could quick charge my iPhone if I needed to. The only thing I wish they had done different here would be having a higher output through the USB-C port. While it supports 65W input it only does 18W output. So it can quick charge a phone but cannot charge a laptop.

4. Lastly Hulkman claims this thing works as low as -40C. I haven’t had the chance to curry this claim but I have started a battery at around -15C with no trouble. I live in Minnesota so having cold weather charging support is super important to me.

I can’t tell you what to buy but I can tell you if I had to buy another jump starter and I had any amount to spend: this is it."
5,Great customer service response,2021/3/26,"Update 5/21 Hulkman has gone above and beyond to make it right. Great response, as a result of this scenario they have created a help center so it doesn’t happen again. Customer service has been great at addressing the issue and going above and beyond to make things right, so I’ve updated my review. When using the product to its instructions it works great.

Orig review: Typical bad scenario, trying to rush my sick dog to the vet and my car battery was dead. Good thing I have my brand new Hulkman jump starter right? Wrong. I connect it, error 2 appears on screen. What does that mean? I reconnect, restart, try everything and nothing works. I Google the error code, nothing.
So hulkman must have a website, YouTube channel, etc. with support options to troubleshoot right? Wrong yet again! Who redesigns a web site and takes down the entire site? Including all contact and support options for their product."
4,"Great, but still room for improvement.",2021/4/9,"This thing charges very fast, has usb outlet for charging phone or other devices, a white and red LED light with constant on or flashing, an easy to see screen with battery percentage, and is capable of starting large engines.

But the 12v outlet is pretty useless. It actually outputs at 14-16 volts, which is above the maximum voltage cutoff for inverters making them incompatable. The only thing the ""so called"" 12v outlet is good for is a heated car blanket or an additional phone charger. This was disappointing and made one of the best features of this product useless and pointless. So i took away a star from my rating because of that.

Other than that it's great and i DO recommend."
5,Works perfectly even if the car has no battery at all!,2021/5/4,"I already own a cheaper off-brand version of these lithium ion jump starter which worked great for starting miscellaneous items like a lawn mower, etc.  However, the first time I needed it to start a small 4 cylinder (1.6L) car engine, it did not work.  Even though the jump battery was 100% charged, the car didn't seem to even recognize that it was attached.  After a little more research I learned that many of these battery pack jump starters won't work when the car battery is missing or too drained to be detected by the battery pack starting circuitry.  So, I research to find one that claimed the ability to overcome this issue.  I first bought the NOCO GeniusBoost GB40.  Determined to test the override feature before I actually needed it, I disconnected the battery cables from the good battery in my 2015 Ram 1500 truck (5.7L) and clamped the NOCO to the truck's battery cables. Of course the NOCO did not detect a battery and showed an error.  I pressed the override button for 3 seconds as directed and still the NOCO showed an error and would not provide any power to the starter.  I tried this several times but could never get the NOCO to work at all...I have to assume the override feature was defective, but I cannot be certain of the issue.  I returned the NOCO and  purchased this Hulkman Alpha 85.  Under the same test (no connected battery at all), setting the Hulkman into override immediately provided power to the truck and easily started the 5.7L V8 engine.  I tried it multiple times and it worked flawlessly.  I then purchased a 2nd one to keep in another car.  So, for the same price (or at the time of this review a $20 lower price)  The Hulkman not only worked perfectly, but has a higher capacity and several additional features compared to the NOCO GB40.  I highly recommend this product!!"
5,BEST PORTABLE JUMP-STARTER... PERIOD!,2021/5/7,"I work for AAA for roadside assistance, and you wouldn’t believe how amazing this product is for the price. I got it when it was on discount (not sure if it still is) but this is a must have. Its one of those things where you don’t need it but must have one on you at all times. Keep in mind since I bought this product I use it 5 days a week constantly on all different types of cars that need a little power to get going (like a honda, toyota, etc...) to cars that need much more juice to power up (like a Mercedes, RV’s, Diesel trucks, etc...). I jumpstart at least 14 cars a day so thats about 70 cars a week. Almost everyone I assist they tell me “That little thing will start my car? *gives a little chuckle* You can try but I doubt it will jumpstart my car.” Then they get a surprised look on their face when it actually jumpstarts their vehicle. The charge on the battery lasts me pretty much all day depending on the types of cars I jumpstart, and the fast charging with USB type C makes it go from 0 to 100 in about 30mins or less. I don’t normally do reviews on things I buy on amazon but this was too great of a product to pass on the review. If you're looking for a powerful portable jump-starter stop looking and add this product to your cart it will be worth it."
1,Very weak,2021/5/11,I sell cars and i use jumpers very frequently. This one have not been able to jump start any car. Super weak not enough power.
1,This one did not charge.  After two hours of continuous charge still at 0%.,2021/5/12,"I watched many reviews about this Hulkman jump starter seemed a good buy, but this particular product sent to my home was a bust.  It maybe designed in the USA but still made in Communist China.  I may go with another product company later."
5,There is Great then there is this (Amazing)!!!,2021/5/21,"Read many reviews on this product and could not help but notice a excitement about how pleased so many people were. So I decided I would try this product as I had a real challenge for it. I have a second car which is a 2007 Lincoln MKZ with a large block 8 cyl. it has been setting for weeks and battery was not just down but dead, dead. Like death eating a doughnut dead. No lights, no ringing when key goes in ignition no power door locks, absolutely nothing. I took my Alpha 85 out of the box read the instructions. (Incredible Simple). It was on the 81% charged to 100% in 11 min. I plugged the cables to the A85 then turned power on and clamped to battery post. I immediately got the error light Which I expected knowing there was no power in that battery to be read by A85. I simply pushed both buttons down and held them for about 2 seconds and the force start mode kicked in instantly with green ready light. As I got in the car to start it I was hoping to see it turn the engine over expecting at minimum a strained starting at best and that would have made me happy. However to my disbelief, that engine turned over and cranked like it was coming of the show room floor with (ZERO) strain. It took my power from 100% to 92%.

If you are looking for the best at a great price point as I gave only $79 for Grab this baby. It has no competition as it is in a class of it's own. Everything about this product screams quality state of the art. (Well Done Hulkman)! I am buying 2 more tomorrow for my other 2 cars. Don't ever be caught again looking for heavy duty cables to jump a big 8 cyl engine with most people are driving 4 cly and don't want to try to jump you for fear of damaging their battery. This is I feel the most value from a purchase of any product I have made in a long time. As for not having it's on carrying case, true it doesn't but the box it came in works just fine for now, Good design. I will Happily buy myself a hard box as I can afford to spend $15 when you only pay $79 for the A85. Even if I gave $129 I would still be happy to get the hard carrying case separate. Oh well, Nuff said."
5,This thing is amazing,2021/5/31,"I had my 350z in storage for over 5 years with a battery that went dead long ago. I got this because I needed a jump starter that was easy to use and quick to jump start a vehicle. Well, I decided to connect it to the 350z and test it out to see if it worked. I was shocked to find out it started that dead battery within 10 mins of leaving this thing connected. I primarily purchased this for our LandCruiser so when we are out on the trails... and forget to turn something off... I have a backup. I trust it on the trails and a solid product. The price I paid compared to the other big brands out there... is truly amazing. I even dropped it from 4ft by accident and was worried that I broke it. Nope, it turned on and charged one of my other batteries that I had stored since new just fine. Honestly, great product all around."
3,No Joy on Dead Battery,2021/6/3,"UPDATE:  The seller read my review and provided a new device to use next time.  I increased the star rating to 3 stars.  My dead battery was at less than 3% battery, and my sister-in-law's battery was at 1%.  When the battery is that low the email I received said to put on ""force start"" mode by holding down the power and battery buttons at the same time.  I am hopeful the new device will help during the next battery out condition.  Oh, also the email from the seller said to put on the terminals on the battery only.  Usually I put the black on a ground somewhere on the car, and in some cars there are terminals under the hood while the battery is hidden elsewhere.  Also, this thing charges up fast--I wish my phone was this fast!  If the new one works on the next bad battery, my rating is likely to go up.I'm giving this product a 1 star review because it did not work when I needed it.  I have a car I don't drive often that requires the biggest battery available to turn over the big v8 engine.  I bought a new battery 6 months ago.  I start the car once a month and let it run for awhile.  Apparently that is not enough.  (The manual says that the car should be driven at least 200 miles/month.)  This month the battery was dead.  I bought this item to jump start it.  One of the questions answered was if it would start a car with no battery.  The answer was yes, but apparently when the battery is dead dead dead, this jumpstarter did not work.  The device showed 100% charge but after hooking it up to the battery, it just went to sleep and did not provide the READY bar.  I hooked it up to another car (that was working fine) and the READY bar lit up almost instantly.  I took the battery back to Autozone and the test showed it was only providing 6v not 12v.  Perhaps I'm off base and the jumpstarter's failure to detect anything is correct as there was a lack of continuity in the battery.  I should have used my multimeter to check out the battery myself first.  I did not return the product, but I will update this review when it works under actual conditions."
5,Hulkman,2021/6/9,"I got the Idea that I could also use a vehicle jumper pack as a DIY LED lantern battery...and it works great too. I research and found that this Hulkman is the best on the market right now..many cost a lot more, but from what I've research they are not necessarily better because they cost more. I cut the plug off of a 110v aluminum clamp stlye work light and wired it for 12v with Anderson powerpole connectors to replace a lantern.. no more split fuel, mantles, broken globes, smell or fire risk.  I use a 12v LED bulb. The LED bulb is equivalent to a 60W bulb, so it lights up an area very well and since the LED bulb draws very little amps, the Hulkman last 10+ hours ,I stopped timing it at 10 hours because that's enough to last a whole night if needed and it was at 500% battery life, so it had a lot of power left. It can be recharged by wall wart, 12v car cigarette lighter/solar and it recharges fast too..about 30 minutes. I ordered a 100watt 12v bulb and an inline dimmer switch, that should workout well. Of course the Jumper can charge all battery operated electronics..cellphones, laptops, flashlights..etc, and they can start your vehicle. Pretty nice thing to have on fishing and camping trip...or if SHTF!"
1,Did not work as advertised,2021/6/10,Item did not work followed instructions and called customer service they were no help perhaps item was defective when it arrived regardless I am returning for refund
1,After 32 days Stop working and can’t return Only used twice. Can’t get hold of Company 🥵,2021/6/14,Worked great one time. Only had 32 days and look at pictures it appears battery busted😡 I am a very good Amazon Cust and this is not good.
1,junk,2021/6/27,car was super dead  would not jump it off. hand to send it back and got a jump box 1224.. it is a monster. jump both of my dead cars off that set for a year!
5,"Great product design, great functionality...",2021/7/12,"These folks hit a home run with this product: built like tank, looks great, light weight, fantastic packaging, great jumper clips with enough wire to handle wide-format car batteries. Nice wall-bud fast-charger. Nice included extras (USB cable, 12v cable).

Super easy to use: works instantly to turn over big Mercedes & BMW 400+HP V8s. Very nice user interface (big clear easy to read LED, simple two button operation). Will start a large V8 engine with a near-dead or absolutely dead battery over 15 times on a single charge (uses about 5% per dead-battery start) and can do this over an elapsed period of several weeks or months without being recharged.

Re-charges very quickly (from 30% to 100% in a few minutes). If you have a 12V DC to AC inverter in your car/truck kit that can support a 150 watt draw, you can recharge this system from your car 12v outlet in the same super fast time as using a household 120V outlet - just plug the provided wall-bud charger into your inverter and you're ready to go. It will stay charged and ready to go for months on end when not used. It will work in very cold temperatures.

Overall: an A+ value. I have bought two, and several family members have purchased more after seeing/hearing about mine.

Suggestions for improvement: 1) The simple method for starting a totally dead battery is NOT CLEAR until you learn about it online via posts/videos from other users. This is a VERY VALUABLE feature and should be more clear via the MANUAL and the LED readout. For instance: if the car battery is DEAD, the LED screen instead of saying READY could say, ""ENTER DEAD BATTERY MODE? PRESS THE ON/OFF BUTTON TO CONTINUE"". BTW, the hidden/secret method is: if after being connected to a car battery, the LED does not say ""READY"", hold down both control buttons for a few seconds to enter dead battery mode (dead battery mode places additional load on the system, so the designers made it hard to access to prevent overheating) >> when entering Dead Battery Mode, the system could flash a warning: ""Dead Battery Mode should not be used more than 3x in 10 minutes (or something like that) to prevent heat damage to the cells."" 2) Make the rubber retainer for the jumper-cable-plug-cover a bit longer or more elastic so it stays out of the way while plugging in the jumper cables (would be nice to be able to do this one-handed!)."
1,Absolute crap. Buy something else.,2021/7/13,"Portable, yes. Effective, no.

This couldn’t charge a toothbrush."
2,Don’t get if you own a V8 engine with a big battery.,2021/7/19,"I’m giving it 2 stars because customer service was quick to reply when I was having issues. So great customer service. Anyways… I work for a company that has a fleet of Ford 15 passenger vans (V8 5.4 L). During the pandemic, the vans have been sitting for awhile and many of the vans had dead batteries. We have a current jumper box that works well but it’s bulky and it’s like carrying another heavy car battery around. That’s why we purchased this unit to make life easier since it’s portable. When I hooked the Hulkman up, to my surprise it jumped a van with big battery and V8 engine with no problem. But….. as soon as I unhooked the clamps, battery went dead and van shuts off. It’s unfortunate because I like this unit. It’s nice and it seems like good quality. I jumped multiple vans with a dead battery and had the same results. Finally reached out to customer service and they did not understand what was going on so they sent me a replacement. Once I received it, I tried again. Did the same thing with the 2nd unit. It jumped started but dies as soon as I unhook the clamps. I’ve even left the clamps on after start and it dies 15 secs later.

Conclusion: I haven’t tried it but may work well with a regular car battery. In my opinion, I wouldn’t get this if you plan on using it on a big vehicle with a V8 engine or bigger. You’ll end up with the same issues I went though and I tried it on 5 different Ford V8 vans."
5,Compact yet powerful.,2021/10/18,"I Used this this to jump start a completely dead battery on my mom’s 2001 Nissan Altima. She rarely uses her car nowadays. Since the last oil change of her car in January of this year until October of this year,  she drove a total of only 48 miles! The battery is less than a year old, but due to the lack of turning on the engine for weeks or months at a time, the battery completely drained to the point where the key remote did not open the doors, the car alarm did not sound when manually opening the door with the car key, nor were the headlights or interior lights working and when attempting to turn on the ignition, there was not even a clicking sound.  After reading the ratings and reviews, I decided to purchase the Hulkman Alpha 85 jump starter. I am extremely glad I did. I received it today, read the simple instructions, charged the jump starter using the included usb cable. Th Hulkman was ready to be used in about 5 minutes after charging it. When I connected the included jumper cables from the Hulkman to the car battery terminals, the screen on the Hulkman displayed error code 2, meaning the battery is completely dead. This required the use of a forced charge from the Hulkman. This is performed by pressing the on/off button and the LED control button simultaneously. This initiates a very quick charge into the battery. Immediately after initiating the forced charge, a split second later, the car alarm system sounded, indicating a charge into the battery. Immediately afterward, I turned on the ignition and the car came back to life! I disconnected the Hulkman from the battery and let the car run a while and drove it for about an hour to charge the battery. I started the car 6 hours later to test out the battery and it still works. The  Hulkman Alpha 85 truly works great. Simple to use, quick to charge and quickly jumps your car battery even when completely dead. Feels durable even though it is compact. I highly recommend this as a must have tool for your automotive needs. It"
1,Hoping this defective unit is covered under warranty,2021/12/13,"Purchased this unit 6 months ago. I fully charged it and stored it away in my trunk. Finally needed it today, got an error 2 message, and had to force start it. My battery pack has drained to 23% in six months. Luckily I was able to get the vehicle started but am unsure whether to charge back up or what. I'm afraid that it may not work the next time I need it or worse yet, explode or catch fire. I reached out to the number on the warranty card but no one answers. Hulkman, if you read this please reach out to me, I need some help."
2,Is this a scam? I can't get a hold of manufacturer.,2021/12/19,"So I bought this after seeing its review and comparing it to others like NOCO and another one. I eneded up with this one because of its safety features as well as cold weather durability.

Got it, it was delivered next day. Awesome, right? Well I get it and read the instructions most of which I had already seen in review videos but I did my due diligence as it is an investment over all. I found it comforting yet questionable that it had an additional warranty if you became a member and they provide a QR code for easy access, easy enough who wouldn't take 5 seconds for another year of warranty right? So I log in, it asks me for ID number which I have no idea where to get it from and there's no serial number on the device or packaging and I didn't receive an email so I try to just add a few things and nothing worked but I tried my email and it went through but honestly it shouldn't have because they didn't know it. Longer story short, I received an email confirming a request which is fine but THEN I received another email in some kind of Asian character/writing which totally reminded me or a scam popup but I ordered it from the HULKMAN STORE, ya know?

So I tried to contact them and have yet to hear from them AT ALL Y'ALL! I sent an email, I tried chatting, I tried calling all to no avail.

💥AS FAR AS THE PRODUCT REVIEW!!💥
Look, it looks beautiful but when I tested it the battery drained suspiciously fast, like 3 percent at a time and it didn't start the battery and so then I tried charging my phone and it drained the battery just as fast. Yes, I know about the starting a REALLY DEAD battery adjustment and yes I read the do's and don'ts and how to optimize it but I got nothing but doubt.

I made a big investment in this financially as well as for my safety and security and now I have a $200 brick so I'm disappointed and I hope that the manufacturer is real and that this is rectified and that I'm proven wrong in my doubt and trust in this product.

HULKMAN, PLEASE CONTACT ME."

1,Error Message,2021/6/5,Everything is good except when i plugged up cables to jump start  my car it only gave me a ERROR CODE and would not jump anything like its a defect. Im not goin through sending back with all that process headache. Ill just keep for emergency use to charge cellphone or laptop if lights go out from weather. Other then that it only met 50% of the deal purchase which is still BS to me.....
3,Won't jump start below freezing.,2022/1/9,"I've had mixed luck with these. Regarding this one: On the one hand, it's a great power bank. On the other hand, it's operating temperature according to the very poorly written instructions say that it won't operate below 0C (32f), which, of course, is the highest likelihood time one may need to jump start a vehicle.  Well, this morning it was 12f out and I needed to jump start the truck. Rather than pull the car around and do it, I thought, hey, time to give this a try. Of course it wouldn't do it. It wouldn't even provide the 12v I needed to run the air compressor to air up a tire. I'm rather tired of these not performing the way they are supposed to. It's not user error or poor expectations. I know how to jump start a vehicle and I know how these are supposed to work."
1,Just doesn’t work,2021/8/12,"First case of seeing amazing reviews and being completely off. I bought two of these, one fore each of my cars. Ironically I needed to jump both my cars within a month of purchase. I tried BOTH of them on both of my cars and it barely had enough power to get the electronics to respond in the car and no where near enough power to even try to turn over. Portability is great, easy directions, love that it has a light, BUT IT CANNOT START CARS."
5,Jumping a dead battery has never been more satisfying,2021/5/31,"This thing is awesome, & hands down the most superior jump box I've ever used. Its so much better than the one I was replacing it with that it's not even a close comparison as they are just on two completely different levels. The funny thing though is that I paid about $30 more for my older one. My older one was only 5,000 Milliamps but it would take like 9 hour's to charge, this one charges at such an incredible speed that it almost seems impossible. It's equivalent to watching a video load on dial up internet. Sure that's extremely slow in the case of loading media, but for charging something that's a remarkable speed, in fact the first time I ever charged it, I plugged it in, & when I came back to check to make sure that it was all hooked up sufficiently it already read fully charged. I was dumfounded & in disbelief. The ONLY, & I mean ONLY critique I have surrounding this item is that if your battery is completely dead you will need a charge greater than 25% to jump it, which doesn't make much sense to me cause for example if you were to jump your battery when this thing has a 100% charge it only brings your charge down to 94% after jumping a completely dead battery, & therefore only uses 6% of juice to execute this function, so why would you need such a high minimum charge? That's my only complaint & that's ONLY because I am of the generation that NEEDS something to complain about & that's all I was able to come up with, so.... Additionally I would recommend buying a bag or case in conjunction with this item as the contents in the box are difficult to organize perfectly so that the box closes the way that it arrived."
1,DID NOT WORK AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS USELESS! DID NOT RESPOND.,2021/10/6,"GOT THIS, CHARGED IT AND ATTEMPTED TO USE IT. ALL I GOT WAS AN ERROR MESSAGE. I WROTE THE SELLER AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO GET NO RESPONSE. I AM STUCK WITH THIS USELESS ITEM BECAUSE I CANNOT RETURN FROM THE CARRIBBEAN. WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,Wall charger failed on first use. Replaced fast!,2020/12/22,"Arrived with 67% charge.  Wall charger popped and failed first time ever being plugged in.  Returning whole item.Replacement shipped fast.  Works perfectly.  Can't blame the actual unit, the wall charger is what failed. Finally happy!"
5,There is a cheaper case alternative for the Hulkman,2021/10/19,"I haven't had a chance to actually use the Hulkman yet (perhaps a good thing!) so I thought I'd mention my experience with buying a case to keep it in.

I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a case for my new Hulkman Alpha85, and I took a chance on this one from Caseling: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071VM23HQ (I was worried it would be too small, but this turned out not to be true). For only $14.99, it will do the job and more.

If you go to that page, I left a review with photos of my Hulkman inside that case. There is room for even more than just the jump starter, I put a flashlight and a small wrench and screwdriver as well, with room to spare. The case is smaller and more compact than the OEM case and will take up less room in your car. In my instance, there was very little room under the passenger seat, but this case fit fine. The OEM case, which is much thicker (higher) would not have fit. I hope this helps some out there that don't want to pay an arm and a leg for the OEM case, or the oversized and overpriced (IMO) Aenliosi case (they keep raising and raising the price of the Aenliosi every week, taking advantage of the high price of the OEM case, as of today it's $24 - it was $17 not long ago). You can save a few bucks and just get this one instead. Hope that helps someone on the fence about what case to buy."
5,AMAZINGLY POWERFUL,2021/6/7," I saw this device in a video on YouTube. It was just sitting in the background, being used to charge a cell phone. I liked the look of it, and wondered what it was. I did some research and found that it's primary function is for jump-starting a vehicle which has a battery with low voltage.
Watch the video to see how it performs."
1,Lasted 4 months and died.,2021/8/16,This was working just fine the first 5 or six times I used it. Jumped a car at 89% charged. Started right up. Only dropped 2%. The neighbor had a car that was completely dead. Tried to jump it and nothing happened. Unit dropped to zero and now won't charge. Had real high hopes for this unit.
5,Awesome jumpstarter with quick charge feature at a really good price,2020/12/22,"First, let me start off by saying I really enjoy using this jump starter. From the moment I unboxed it, I knew this was a high quality product. The feel and weight give the impression of something that will last a long time. I was very impressed when I hooked the fast charger up to it and found how quickly this jump starter was taking a charge. Within an hour, it went from 30 percent to fully charged. And when I first used it on a vehicle with a dead battery, it had that engine turned over and running in a matter of seconds.

I'm a professional Automotive Technician, and I've owned and used several battery jump packs that fail after a couple of months of use, some even sooner. And needless to say, they didn't perform as they claimed they should. But the HULKMAN jump starter has been my go to booster for the past month and its holding up very well. This product exceeded all the expectations I had. I simply can't say enough good things about this jump starter.

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a jump starter. Don't waste your time with the false claims and under performing jump packs from the other guys. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this one. You'll be glad you bought this the first time you use it."
5,Great Quality Battery Pack With Latest 2021 Features!,2020/12/3,"As shown in photos, the huge white/green LCD display is easy to see, understand, and use.  The powerful AC-USB-C charger really charges fast, or you can use just about any compatible phone/tablet/laptop charger with USB-C.  Output is safety-timed to enable most cars with weak battery to crank over enough to start.  A special mode enables totally dead cars to start, too.  THIS FEATURE is most significant, as many competitive battery packs of lower cost cannot do this difficult task.  I'll report back on long term lithium battery longevity.  Actual Pack capacity is close to 12,000 so the 20,000 reading must be peak output.  I wish it came with a carry case, but most handy bags work.  Edit: PERFECT CASE fits Hulkman and ALL its accessories... Made by ""Caseling"" on Amazon, intended for Noco GB70, p/n X001EV6DL1, SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS OF PERFECT FIT, open and closed up."
1,Just didnt work.,2021/4/22,Pluggede it in and the battery power dropped 3% in short order but the ready light never came on. Car never started. Will be returning.
5,READ THE MANUAL,2021/5/12,"If u see any bad reviews on this it’s most likley due to people who didn’t read the manual, I spent an hour trying to learn how to use it until I just read the manual 😂! GREAT PRODUCT: AWSOME PRICE / HAPPY CUSTOMER NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR... if ur battery if fully drained the READY sign will pop up but when u turn the key a ERROR 2 will pop up and ur car won’t start, all u have to do is press the 2 buttons at the same time for 5 sec and starts the battery and if it dosent just keep doing it, I had to press & hold  the 2 buttons more than 3 times  but after I heard the engine my heart melted as I fell Inlovewill do an update in 6 months !"
1,It’s broken already,2021/4/8,I liked it when it worked that one time
1,Not a good purchase,2021/1/17,"I did not like the way this worked , the housing was brittle in cold weather and broke of . Would not recommend ."
1,Doesn’t work,2021/6/2,"Crap. The box the product came in was smashed and damaged but the shipping box was perfectly fine. The starter only turns on when it is plugged to the wall charger, hence it’s is completely useless. Tried to exchange it for a new one, something glitched And could only get a refund. Defective product all around, save your money and get a better brand."
5,Turns over a big block like a champ!,2021/2/5," This thing is amazing. I have a giant 7.5 liter big block ford. The hulkman Jumps box turns it over FASTER than my battery does. In the included video I had my truck battery completely disconnected and the ignition off so that the truck would not start. I was simply testing if the jump box could turn the engine over on its own. It does it easily! I tested it 5 times or so and still had 92% battery left. This is way more performance than I expect. I also did talk with customer service and they were fantastic. I will be keeping an eye on this brand and probably buy whatever they produce based on my experience. It's hard to find new brands that make quality products these days. Actually it's hard to find any brands that make quality products. Dont buy anything else when it comes to jump boxes, especially since this costs the same or less!"
1,Won't charge past 70%,2021/2/3,Charged for 24 hours and it never went past 70%.
1,It need to be able to start a car that’s completely dead,2021/3/29,I’m not too happy with it if you’re dealing with a car with a completely dead battery that has been sitting for a while it does not let you jumpstart the car I just tried to start a  car It won’t let me I had to connect a Battery with jumper cables with some power in it for it to let me jump the car
4,"Well built, powerful, easy to read color screen, and fastest charging jumpstarter",2021/1/17,Well built but surface is a bit slippery especially if hands are wet or icy. Should have more grippy rubber on the outside. Also no case to store it. Cables and clamps are nice and sturdy Fastest charging of all the jumpstarters on the market with the included high speed wall charger. Those alone are a $20-$30 value. Also comes with 12 volt car charger and usb charger. Powerful 2000 amps should be able to easily jump pretty much any vehicle. Nice bright light and 12 volt output adapter included. Only thing I would like to improve would be an even more powerful larger battery version like in the 3-4000 amps range. A version with a built in inverter or air pump built in version. A special heat protected case so I can leave it in the engine bay at all times without being damaged from the high heat. That way you won’t have to look for it or lose it when you need it the most.
5,"Worked on the first try.  See youtube videos for easy use.  Comes charged, and charges are quick!",2022/3/4,"My mobile mechanic brought over a 10x12 portable charger with a lot of switches and buttons and safety precautions for $200.  After he left, I realized I did not have a 3-prong extension cord (had to order on Amazon), lol.  So....problem NOT solved on Tuesday.  Also found out that charger takes 36 hours to charge and you have to charge it after EVERY USE.  Yesterday, I ordered overnight shipping of the HULK portable charger.  Got it today, and the car fired right up.  For those batteries that are completely dead, you may need to ""force start"" the unit a few times (read manual).  That means holding both the light and charger on button down at the same time for 2-3 seconds.  The unit will tell you when it is ""READY"".  THIS IS GENIUS!!"
4,“A” as Starter; “D” for Electronics,2022/3/13,"I’ve jumped two cars with this, and it’s obviously very powerful for that task. I started each time at 100%, and saw today it was still at 94% after using for the jump. I’d give it 5 stars as a starter (but there are other issues), although both times I’ve had to press and hold the two buttons to reset the charger. I have no idea why. The only issue with that is if you forget what is needed to reset…the directions are printed in tiny light colored font on the back…..not good when you’re under a hood (as I was earlier today).

Separate from being a starter, the main issue I have is that the charging of electronics is really week. For every percent my iPhone goes up the Hulkman goes down. Think about that….if you start with you’re phone at 30% that’s where the Hulkman will be when the phone is charged. I have a small charger that charges my iPhone at least 3 times; I also had an Aukey charger that also started cars, and that charger seemed like it could charge the phone over and over.

Other points —> charging the unit is quick, and it appears to be built like a brick. While the build is comforting, it seems needlessly heavy for the power it delivers to the electronics."
5,"BUY! Works out of box, even on DEAD deep cycle AGM batteries!!",2022/1/7,"Wowzer!  This is the best jump battery ever. READ THIS IF YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD- it will work… press and hold both the power and flashlight buttons at same time after you have put the alligator clips on your battery. It will force the hulkman system into ready mode and immediately jump start your car no matter how dead the battery is. I did it with a fully drained dead battery with no electrical current. This jump battery is so strong it actually will start all my accessories without any other car battery installed. It was delivered with 78% and after reading other reviews tried it out of the box on a car I could not start with several other batteries and jumper cables. And when I say several others- I tried a noco, Duracell and no name brand, then tried a Ford, gm and Nissan. None worked- waited three days to get this one and boom car started!! Love it. The additional functionality is also perfect! So many types of charging option and battery types. It comes with every plug you need to recharge or use with other devices. Register online and get an extended 12 month warranty for a total of 3 years. A few other mentions that is not necessarily important to the charger but just workmanship. Opening the box experience is like opening an iPhone. The parts and pieces are very well laid out, super easy to understand and store. As an added bonus they give you some stickers that I have put all over my car."
1,No better than any other and not worth the money,2021/9/4,"Bought this because of some reviews and when I received it , it was sturdy feeling, but found it is no better then the older one I had.  The very week I received this a friends truck wouldn't start when he was about to leave.  The Hulkman said it was at 100% yet it wouldn't jump the truck.  It said his battery was dead.  Hooked up my jumper cables and his truck started right up.  Certainly not worth the money.UPDATE: After working with the company regarding my problem with the alpha 85 they sent me another stronger Alpha.  As of yet, I haven't had the need to test it, but it was great of them to reach out and send me another one."
5,Charge drops to 85% - maybe a bad unit,2021/12/13,"I could charge mine to 100% but then after sitting it would sit back at 85%; sometimes 89%.  Not sure if a bad battery?  I did see another complaint about this too when I looked at the reviews  Not sure if I will try to order another one, but with my history of batteries levels drop over time.  Doesn't sound like it was ever QA/QC/tested as this should have been caught with a quick shelf life test as it dropped within the hour as I recall.*** Revised Review - 2/7/22 ***I changed my review to 5 stars due to the company's follow up on my return of the product and offered a replacement for me to try so that I would be a satisfied customer.  Now, that's great customer service!  Once I confirmed I was willing to try it out again the product was delivered to me within 48 hours.  From my testing the performance now has been pretty flawless although I've only did limited testing.  This one held the 100% charge for over a week on-the-shelf and then charged a device that was not fully discharged (maybe 80%) over USB-C.  Then the reading was 99% and I jumped an old V8 Chevy Truck and it dropped from 99% to 95%.  It started the truck immediately with out any revving.  Pretty powerful there.  After which I charged an almost dead phone over USB-C and it dropped to 90%.  Not sure if it was the USB-C device or the charge correcting itself.  Definitely giving it 5 stars for the performance, capacity, and customer service.  A+ guys.  If there was a negative it would be that you can't verify the product has a charge outside of the digital readout.  For those of us like to prove something works or matches an LED readout.  To do this you would need to put a load on it if you really wanted to prove there was voltage on the device since there seems to be a protection mechanism (although I'm assuming most of these devices are like this).  I may purchase one of those load testers to make it easy at some point for piece of mind but it appears to work well so far."
5,Hulkman beats noco and imazing!!!All you need to know,2021/3/19,"For those who are looking for a jumpstarts with great quality and capability pls look here! I haven’t write a product review on Amazon for years because there is barely one product can shock me. But hey, this hulkman jump starter deserves my review. Anyone who wants to buy a jump starter might saw brands like imazing and noco on Amazon. I used to have a imazing but I lost it. Now I have noco gb40 and hulk man alpha 85 side by side comparison. For the same price, hulkman has 2000A jumpstart capability while noco has 1000A and hulkman is 74 Wh battery while the noco is 24Wh. Cables in hulkman are solid built including charging cables, jumping cables, and cig lighter cable. They are thick and rugged. Clamps are the same sizes. Unless you really care about the size which I don’t . Hulkman is definitely the one to choose from. It’s massive. Only draw back is there is no carrying case or bag, but the noco carrying bag doesn’t have good quality either. I am sure that hulkman jumpstarter satisfy IP65 waterproof rating cause all caps for the sockets are snug especially the one on the clamp while on Noco they are pretty loose. The cap on Noco clamp just pop off without effort. I didn’t go with the imazing again cause the clamps were pretty small although the quality is fine too. To sum up, Imazing is good for budget. Hulkman is good for quality and capability at low price. Noco is good for its compatible size. Thanks for viewing"
5,This jump starter deserves 10 stars,2021/3/11,I had to update my review after writing a previous one. I was wrong on my first review I thought that the jump starter couldn't jump off a fully dead battery but it's does.. The way a found out how it works is by reading other customers reviews. When your battery is fully dead a yellow light well come on the front of the jump starter with the #2 that means hold down the power button and the light button right next to it at the same time. Then it will say ready then you go start the car. I had to do it yesterday and it started right up after I did that. I hope this review helps someone you don't understand how that part works. This is the best jump starter you can purchase the price is excellent and it does exactly what a heavy duty one would do so being light weight is so much better. If you're thinking about buying it you won't be disappointed👌🏾
5,Jumpstart yourself,2021/8/17,This worked great! It’s way better than lugging jumper cables and you don’t have to find someone with a car to help.
4,Almost perfect,2022/4/4,"This is an amazing jump starter.
However, it did have one issue: it did not detect my car's battery.
Going to the website, I found the issue: it does not always detect every car's battery.
It essentially acted like it wasn't even attached to the battery at all. It's supposed to bring up some displays and start charging the battery, but apparently it doesn't work on every make and model. Considering that I drive a Honda Civic, I suspect this is pretty common, though it may be my battery instead (it's not the original battery).
Sadly, there is NOTHING about this issue in the instructions, which are not nearly as good as the charger itself is.
However, the website does have instructions for dealing with that. You can force it to start the car anyway, though this does disable the safety features. Read the website before doing this, though hopefully you won't have to.
Starting my car from a completely dead battery only drained 7% of the charger...it has a pretty massive capacity, and my car started INSTANTLY when I actually used the charger.
The hardware of this charger is far better than I could ever hope for, the issue is the software and lack of troubleshooting instructions except on the website."
1,NFG,2021/7/30,Totally unsatisfactory. Battery capacity minimal and it crashes when you try to keep a car running for even 5 minutes after a jump. Would have returned it except return window closed. Don't buy this.

1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!,2022/4/18,"I purchased this item for my 16 year old son to have in his car if his battery died so he didn't have to ask a stranger for help. I couldn't check whether it worked upon receipt of the item because I didn't have a dead battery handy. Now that the return window is closed, my son's battery died when he was out driving on his own and THIS PIECE OF JUNK doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!!! He was left stranded for hours until we could get to him and help him with his battery. And now we can't exchange it because the return window has closed.
We are so angry with this seller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I AM WILLING TO CHANGE MY REVIEW IF HULKMAN STANDS BY THEIR PRODUCTS AND REPLACES OURS WITH A FUNCTIONAL ONE."

5,Nice Charger,2021/10/29,This is an excellent product.  Easy to use and charging response is outstading.
5,Best Jump-Starter Ever ... Peace of Mind!,2021/9/28,"My car's battery is still in good health (after getting it tested at AutoZone) but sometimes my car won't start, so I need to jump-start my car.

One time, I had a friend who helped me jump-start the car. The very same day I placed an order for HULKMAN Jump Starter and its protective case. It's a great product especially with a USB-C charging input, a display for battery status, and warnings.

In 1st instance, I had to go somewhere and was running late. I sat in my car and tried to start it but no response. I grabed the jump starter from the trunk and connected it to the battery. In less than 30 seconds, it showed READY and I was able to start the car.

In 2nd instance, the same friend asked for help with a jump start. His jump starter was in his car trunk and the trunk won’t open when the battery is dead. I connected the HULKMAN Jump Starter and READY didn’t show up. The display showed a warning with code 2. So his car battery’s voltage was too low. So read the instructions to FORCE START. We had to do multiple FORCE START and in the end, the battery level was 76%. Finally, the display showed READY and we were able to start the car. (Chevy Camaro)

In 3rd instance, my car didn’t start after I finished pumping in the gas. Glad I had the Jump Starter in the trunk. READY in less than 5 seconds.

Believe me, you won’t regret the PURCHASE!"
5,Works fine,2022/1/29,"1st time using it.

Car did not start this morning but within a couple minutes, the hulkman alpha85 had it running.

Very easy to use
The instructions are very easy to understand
Even someone with no auto mechanical experience can operate it.

Had a 100% charge before jumping and after 1 jump I still had 87% of a charge left so it's very realistic that someone can get 5-7 jumps per charge

Holds a charge very well. Bought mine in May 2021 charged it and left it in my trunk. Went through an arizona summer and January 2022 it still had 100% charge"
5,This is the one you’ve been looking for!!!,2022/2/11,"After exhaustingly reviewing watching videos going on the Internet I finally found this product. Immediately opening this box you will know you bought a quality product. I purchased two $100 jump packs for my boys for Christmas as an impulse purchase. I decided I wanted one for myself. If you watch a few Youtubers review of this product you will see by far this is the one you want. A big plus for me was the higher quality clamps wires and accessories. The placement where the cables plug into the battery pack a spot on, the other cheaper brands put the plug on the side which shortens your wire to your car‘s battery . Also the lights for this pack is placed in the perfect spot right where the wires plug into. They are very easy to operate, and cycle easily from low, high, strobe, SOS and a really cool flashing red LED which is very bright even and daylight.  Right out the box the unit was charged at about 84% and took five minutes to charge to 100%. I love the easy to read LED screen on the pack, it makes it extremely easy and very very safe. An absolute must purchase is the carrying case  if it’s everything snug, and all items have a dedicated space which fits perfectly. The case is of high-quality and molded so nothing is bouncing around inside of it you will notice right away the difference. My only regret is not waiting and getting the alpha 85S which has an internal  heater when temperatures go extremely low. I don’t leave a lot of reviews but when I find a quality product I put the time in good luck!"

In a few days I already received full replacement of the entire order.

Starter arrived charged at 80 %.
Once plugged to be fully charged, display showed 79% for an about 10 seconds, than 80%.
After that display charging indicator has dissapeared, and in a few seconds all display indication went off.
Now starter doesn't react on any plug in action. At least display doesn't show anything, doesn't light on when starter connected to the current.
If power button pressed display shows the same 80%.
LED light still wotks.
But booster doesn't take any charge more.

UPDATE
Looks like jump stater itself is OK.
However, power adapter is definitely defective. Tried to charge the stater uaing supplied C-type USB cable and cellphone Anker charger (5V/2.4A).
And it worked. Very slowly, overheating the charger, but it has done the charge from 77% till 100%.
Can't imagine how long and how many attempts (due overheating) would take this way to fill up the booster to the full charge, if discharged till 30/20/10% ☹️
Therefore, upgrading review from zero=1 start to 2.
Device must come with properly working and reliable charging unit."
5,"Simply Amazing, long lasting (YEARS) Its fool proof to use, literally,",2021/9/13,"A must have for anyone, especially long commuters or when in rural areas. I bought 2, one for myself and one for my elderly Mother. Because its fool proof, if you hook the clamps up backwards you'll still be safe and the booster will tell you they are crossed up. It charges in less than 2 hours and will hold that charge for 2 years plus. I tested it on a dead 12v battery by jumping it off 22 times before the charge was drained. The LED lights are very helpful that also SOS signal, in white or red lighting. The bonus features are great because you can plug just about anything into this thing to charge it. Cell phones, tablets , items that are powered by the cigarette lighter in vehicles are even covered with a cable that has what looks to be a vehicle lighter..The fast charge is not fully charged in 20 minutes but thats enough for a jump...I've had many jump packs and these are night and day different than the old NiCad battery jump starter. The ones without lithum batteries take a beating in hot cars and very cold cars, it really drains them and damages the..I've had my 2 for quite a few months and having it in my Tahoe with my heavy duty jumper cables gives me peace of mind when traveling ..These are perfect for woman and men who dont know anything about cars or batteries, because if you do something wrong, the machine will tell you..Always remember Red to Red , Positive terminal to positive and negative to negative. The machine will then say ready on the screen. You'll know immediately when you should turn the engine over ..Its good for 2000 cranking AMPs, so it'll start really big gasoline engines. The jump box will fit in most glove boxes, so it doesn't take up; much space. The jumper also comes with several bonus cables, cell phone, battery cables, DC cables and charging  cable, so its best to keep everything together in one box"
5,"Great, rugged design - Great warranty service & holds a charge",2022/4/9,"So I bought this back when it was on special in April 2021. It came charged and never used it (pandemic = no client meetings in person) until I needed to go on a roadtrip for work in my aging (gracefully) Saab. It was still at 83% so straight away that makes me a happy man. By comparison I have an old Stanley jump starter which is the old (NiCd perhaps?) heavy battery and it used to lose charge like no tomorrow.

So I tried to charge it up with the charger - it turned out it was broken but it's regular USB-C so used another charger. Called Hulkman and it was an absolute breeze to get a replacement charger - came within 2 days. My pet peeve these days is talking to either a. a computer or b. a clueless support person who only reads from a script. In this case I spoke to a person who was in Nicaragua who was very helpful, set expectations and got the job done. That's what we all need from support.

So on both charge retention and support these guys get a 5 star for me. Design is also nice - I like the large display and rugged design. The ability to charge anything via the USB (Quick Charge 3.0 no less for fast charging of your mobile) and USB-C (18W), plus the cigarette lighter (for plugging in the tire inflator) makes this extra versatile.

If I see it going on special again for the 80 bucks I picked it up for, or if I see the EVO case for it hitting 20 bucks I'm definitely going to bite. We all know every car should have jump leads, breakdown water, rations, spare windshield washer fluid and a coat. I'd argue that every car should also have it's own jump starter - with the old NiCd ones, it's a lot to roll around in the back but with these new Lithium Polymer batteries, they are so light and compact that it's trivial to have it stored onboard and you only need to recharge it every year or so.

Overall it's a 5 for me, but I've dinked it down to 4 for portability - it is a bulky item - with the smaller car jumpers (eg 8000 mAh) they are so small you can put them in your laptop bag for double duty as a laptop / phone charger while you're on a plane etc), but that's nit picking.

5,Worked great,2022/2/23,"My car died in my driveway, I ordered this since I always wanted one and didn't need to go anywhere immediately, and I was able to jump it with no issue the next day. I have a Honda Civic and it uses about 5-8% of the battery each time I had to jump it (the battery was DEAD... so I had to jump it a few things while the alternator was playing catch up).

Something to bear in mind is that the safety features are expecting your battery to have at least a small amount of charge in it, otherwise it won't detect if it's ready to jump. If your battery is totally dead, like mine was, you actually have to do an override with a few button presses, but luckily they detail this on their website. Just something to be aware of."
5,This beast really holds its charge!!!,2021/12/2,"What I dislike:  With the pretty premium price tag, and all the confident backing of the MFG, you have to purchase the case separately. LoL  Not a big deal, once this Hulk proves it's point of being reliable.I have a car which I keep it garaged most of the time, where I only drive it for a short amount of distance every 2 weeks.  DieHard Gold (standard lead-acid) battery is over 6 years now, and still performing great.However, I get worried that it may die on me suddenly.  I purchased this Hulkman jump starter after doing some research, and this is the one!  I fully charge it, then I re-charge it after about 2 months, or so, but the remaining charge is still at 100%!  Probably  like more than 99% remaining since it does charge for a few minutes.  Absolutely amazing!I never had to jump start my vehicles yet after buying the Hulkman, thanks to my DieHard batteries, but I'm sure them ""Youtubers"" are very good example.  However, when in need, I have it.  Even when it's my friend's car, co-worker's car, I can help.  I never direct jump another vehicle using my car, and I boldly refuse to do so.  I've had several bad experiences in the past doing so, with the alternator suddenly giving out on my several cars I had owned during my 37 years of owning my own car experience since my high school days."
5,It's Worth the Money,2022/5/7,"This thing is awesome! I was having trouble in the winter with my car battery not having enough juice to start my car if I let it sit for more than 5 days. So I bought one of those $45 lead-acid battery jump starters that also has a built-in air compressor. Let's compare that jump starter's performance to the Hulkman's. First of all, the $45 jump starter is the size of 2 big lunch boxes and weighs over 10lbs. After charging up the $45 jump starter for a few hours, I could get maybe 5 jumps of a weak battery out of it before it would need to be recharged. Then, if I left it unplugged in my house for a week, it wouldn't have enough juice left to get a single jump out of it. So I started leaving it plugged in all the time to ensure that if I ever needed it, it would be charged and ready to use. If I needed to use the $45 jump starter in the morning before going to work, when I got to work, I would take it inside and plug it in to make sure that when I left later that day I'd have enough juice to jump start my car if necessary. This whole arrangement was not convenient to say the least. Then, I read about these new lithium ion battery jump starters like the Hulkman. I decided to pay the bucks to get one and try it, and it was worth it. The Hulkman is about the size of box of legal envelopes, and weighs less than 4lbs. In December, I charged up the Hulkman in less than an hour (it came partially charged). At that time, my battery was completely dead, so a single jump depleted about 10% of my juice as indicated by the charge indicator on the Hulkman which read 90%. The car cut off once after the 1st jump, so I had to do it again. I estimate the Hulkman could jump start a completely dead battery like mine (small 4 cylinder Japanese car) maybe 6 times before running out of juice. Using it regularly over the next 3 or 4 weeks to jump a weak, not completely dead battery, barely any juice would be depleted for each jump. The display told me I still had 98% charge after the first jump. I had no fear that I wouldn't have enough juice when I needed it. Then, I fully charged it to 100% and left it in my car outside in my driveway throughout the whole winter from January to May before using it again. I live in Hampton Roads, Virginia, so the winters aren't severe, but we did have plenty of sub-freezing days during that period. After all that time, it was still at 100% charge. I used it to jump a very weak battery - not completely dead, but very depleted - and it said I had 90% charge left. That's after sitting OUTSIDE ALL WINTER LONG FOR MONTHS!!! I had to jump it again because, as usual, the car cut off after the 1st jump. Now I had 84% juice. When I got to work, I took it inside, and it recharged to 100% in LESS THAN 30 MINUTES while I was talking to my boss and a coworker about how awesome it is. Moral of the Story: For God's sake, just pay the extra bucks an get yourself a jump starter that is reliable, convenient, and that will give you peace-of-mind. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on the $45 piece of junk."
5,This thing is crazy good,2022/3/18,"I work where we have a holding lot for over 400 vehicles. Mostly trucks. I have started as much as a 6.6liter diesel. My team calls me to use this jump box all the time when they can’t get 1 or 2 standard jump boxes to work. For anyone saying this is weak, you must not be reading the instructions.

If a battery needs more than a little help, you MUST put the jump box in force start mode. The quick charger on this thing is crazy good. I’ve gone from around 65% to 100% in around 20 minutes or less.

The case is worth it. I didn’t get the case originally. It has been a huge help. It does NOT come with the unit only listing.

By the way, in the time I’ve had it, I have jumped at least 50 cars and trucks thus far. Still works great."
4,Basic practical flaws but outstanding build. 4.5 stars.,2022/2/18,"The product seems very solid and made of quality materials. But it is off to a disappointing start. It is as if the designer thought that any user was no older than 40, does not live in a cold climate and whose battery always dies in a well lighted area.

What I mean is the display screen can show three or four different icons, depending upon your particular situation The device has a printed description of the meaning of the icons and which buttons to push as a result. The chart is embossed in the face of the product. It’s a good idea in theory, but the font is so small thin and not contrasting enough with the background that anyone over 40 will find it impossible to read. Who has a magnifying glass in their car, and even if you do, it is cold and you’re wearing gloves and now you have to dig around in your car, which because the battery is dead, has no light, to look for the magnifying glass or fumble for the one on your phone.

Second, there are 5 pieces. The unit, the jumpers, the cigarette lighter adapter, the USB and the wall charger. Plus the manual.

It does not come with a carrying case. The idea is you carry this in your car because your battery never dies in your garage it’s always when you are in the parking lot of the grocery store, it’s five below and it’s dark.

So if you don’t buy the carrying case, you’re gonna be putting it all in a shoebox or a plastic bag. Aggravatingly, the case that they recommend is not custom to this particular unit and while all the pieces fit, the instruction manual does not.

There are two switches, one powers up the unit and the other turns on the LED flashlight. Again, there are icons on them but they are nearly impossible to read. Get yourself a gray sharpie because a black one is not going to show up when you want to mark what each of the switches does. However, the light is very bright and the switches are solid and easy to use. (Everything about the materials is high quality).

Finally, as far as the syntax and grammar of the instructions, let me put it this way, the person who wrote the copy for the listing, which art in perfect English, is not the same one who wrote the instructions.

Everything on this seemed great when you are in a lab environment. I think it has some significant weaknesses for use in the field and it should’ve been tested in real world conditions with real people.

That said, I will repeat that the build is high-quality, and the same can be said of the accessories. All cables are thick and well proportioned. I am confident that when I call it up for duty, it will do its job on my 600 HP V8."
5,"Best Jumpstarter, Easy To Use",2021/7/9,"Very well made, excellent design. No need to push any extra buttons to enable the jump starter. Very attractive design, even the cable clamps are beautifully made. All parts have a premium look and feel. USB charging port supports my fast charging Motorola phone. Hulkman came with 88% charge, and charged to 100% in less than ten minutes. Impressive. Have not jump started anything yet, but I don't doubt its capability. There are many excellent reviews, and this is possibly the best jump starter/power pack available at this price and above. My only complaints are lack of carrying case (a very nice Hulkman case is available, and there are others which will work), and the wall charger got hot after ten minutes of charging (all it took to get to 100%). *Edit: A fast charger getting warm is normal. Used it on a different outlet and it was fine. I read in the questions that someone else had this issue, but doesn't seem to be common, no worries. It charges up really fast. Charging blocks can get hot, especially ones like this at 65W. I understand why Hulkman is the top rated jump starter. I would recommend it. It's not clear in the instructions, but my phone charger with type C connection was also able to charge the battery pack, just not as fast as the included high speed wall charger. The LED lights are a great feature with high and low settings, flash, SOS and red flashers. Extremely high quality including the clamps and accessories. 12V socket works, and USB port charges devices in a jiffy. Haven't jumped a car yet but I have no doubt this will do the job. Extended warranty one more year by signing up at Hulkman. Excellent product, Thank You! One more thing, I believe this has an override function for totally dead batteries, which is also nice. Do not attach the cables to your body, or anyone else's. And hey, let's be careful out there! Take this with you for peace of mind."
5,Jumping for Dummies,2022/3/7,"I live in the Boston area, and didn't own a car for 15 years or something.  So, when I bought a car during COVID, there were little things I sort of forgot about (like making sure you run your car every few days in the winter).  I still commute via subway, so don't drive every day and mostly use my car as a grocery getter and for weekends away.  After suffering a dead battery in a parking garage at work, and another in the street in front of my house a month later, I decided I needed a better option than roadside assistance or relying on the help of others.  I did some research and found a Popular Mechanics review listing this as their top pick for best portable jump starters.  This'll age me, but I was floored to discover such a thing existed!  Hooray for technology!Here's how using the device actually went for me with a 2018 Subaru:I opened the box and turned the Hulkman on - it arrived with an 81% charge.  I read the instructions which were super easy and left zero confusion.  I plugged in the jumper clamps, put on some rubber gloves, and brought the unit outside to attach to my battery.  An error message popped up once I connected to the battery, so I flipped over the Hulkman unit to read the back to see what the error meant.  It was the #2 error, which meant I had a completely dead battery and needed to force start.  I held down both the power and light buttons simultaneously to go into force start mode.  The green button lit up, indicating ""Ready to Start"" - so I turned the key and the engine started successfully!  Easy as that.  The battery only dropped from 81% to 74% to get my car running.  Awesome!!If you're reading this and considering a purchase, I can't recommend it highly enough.  I do a fair amount of camping in the summer, so can see plenty of other ways to use the Hulkman unit, too.  Money well spent!"
5,Wow!!!,2022/1/18,"Our 2016 Escape has a bad battery.  It has a auto-light feature which we always kept on so our headlights would always have them on when we need them.  We started having problems when we left our hatch open for a long time while packing for a trip...totally dead battery (the Escape keeps all of the interiors and the running lights on while the hatch is up).  I have a nice charger, but the last time we went on a trip, the battery was dead and it took almost an hour to get us going again.  Out of precaution I bought this jumper, and glad I did...we were going out of town a few weeks ago, and...dead battery.  I received this little dude the day before and had it fully charged...hooked it up to the battery and the car started right up.  It went down to 96%.  We kept loading and I had to jump it again...93%.  Unfortunately, this was happening around Xmas and New Year so I haven't had the battery replaced yet, but we had the same thing happen at my in-laws a few times, and I can say the only issue was I had to leave it on the battery for maybe 30 seconds to a minute before it was charged enough to start.  I am very happy and I feel very smart for having this in my car at all times.  I'm amazed this little dude packs such a punch.  I have a jumper that's at least 3x this size, and  I paid about the same amount for it and this is better."
5,Don't Believe those 1 star ratings - read this,2022/4/15,"Before I bought this product I read loads of the reviews and after reading some of the 1-star reviews I was a bit hesitant in ordering.  Now that it arrived I can easily say it was a 5 star experience for me.  Opened it up, it had 85% charge, so I plugged it in and within say 5 mins or so (yes 5 mins) it was charged to 100%. I took it out to the car, which had a completely dead battery - I mean dead as in zero volts - which is why I bought the product in the first place, because it was meant to kick start completely dead (not just drained) batteries.  Anyway, I attached each electrode cable thingmy to the positive and negative parts of the battery and pressed the two buttons for 3 secs per the instructions.  I went into the car turned the key and yip it started first time.  I was frankly amazed.  I thought I might need to try a few times, but yeah first time.  I'll never use jump cables again, this is the only thing to use from now on. - Now some other reviews have complained about the lack of a storage box to keep it in and some reviews have complained about the expensive packaging.  I'm like listen....Yes the packing is expensive looking, but you know what it acts as a storage box - absolutely no need to go buy some hard plastic storage box, the box it came in is good enough. The packing is actually padded, so it protects it - Seriously ignore those reviews about the packing and no storage and use what it came in, lets face it, you'll either keep the product in its box on a shelf in your garage or in the trunk of your car - it's not going on a display shelf after all.- I did read that people thought the cable length was a bit short, and I'd say maybe slightly, but not enough to affect this overall 5-star review.  The length was long enough and remember it's not jumper cables, it just needs to connect to the battery and and sit there until you turn the key, so it's a minor, minor ding at best.- So in summary, 5 stars for sure, and ignore those 1-star reviews, I can only imagine they were just incompetent people that shouldn't be anywhere near an engine bay in the first place.- I do recommend this product 100%"
5,Disabled senior highly recommends HULKMAN,2021/6/15,"What can I say, I've encouraged all my friends and co-workers to get one. My battery was really low and it wouldn't start my car.  The Hulkman arrived on time and charged, so that i was able to use it right away.  It's extremely easy to use and to charge which it does quickly.  I was looking for a really dependable battery jump that was also affordable,  This one has great reviews on Youtube as well.  It is a bit heavy, my neighbor has one that is smaller and light weight, but it took hers 3 attempts to get my car started, due to my circumstances I need something that i can relay on, especially when i get off work at 9PM.  Very pleased with this purchase."
5,Blown away by quality and functionality of Hulkman Alpha 85,2021/9/3,"I accidentally left the lights on in my car and went out to a dead battery.  I didn't need my car for a day and I thought I would just go out and purchase a standard battery charger and leave it on overnight. I hit up my local retailers and saw that battery chargers were just as expensive, if not more so than a jump pack.  After perusing some of the selection on Amazon I decided to try the Hulkman Alpha 85.  I was initially considering a traditional Jump Pack, that comes with a higher capacity and features like an inflator but the Alpha 85 on sale was 30% less than a traditional jumper pack from peak.I was a bit skeptical at first, not being familiar with the Hulkman brand, but all that was laid to rest when I received the Alpha 85. The packaging conveys the message that Hulkman stands by their brand and all the features included echo this sentiment.  It comes with fast charging at 65w over USB-C (adapter included), a USB-C cable for charging other electronics, attachment for a cigarette lighter output, and of course the jumper clamps.  The instructions and help guide were printed on the back of the device making it easy for anyone to jump a car if necessary.  And its miniscule compared to other jump packs i've used in the past.  It could probably fit inside a glove box with some careful packing of accessories.  All in all I am super impressed with this and will recommend it to anyone, especially if it is on sale!"
5,Big Power in a Small Package,2022/2/8,"I have a 5.7 liter V8 engine in my Chevy Tahoe 4X4, and I was skeptical that a starter of this size would start my engine, but as soon as I connected the starter and turned the key, the engine fired right up. I have since started the motor 3 more times on the original charge, and the meter still shows 85% The starter is very light and compact for the amount of power it provides. The unit also came with multiple accessories for charging other items such as cell phones or other rechargeable devices with a USB ""C"" type connection. I would recommend this starter to anyone who needs a reliable and powerful starter in a small, lightweight, and portable package. Jl, Ventura, CA"
1,This did not work for me.,2022/1/19,"I like the feature and ease of use. No question it recharged very fast and like the light feature. I had a lease 2019 Jeep I need to return to the dealer in a few days. This did what it said to do. But would not start the Jeep. That reason I purchased it for a Higher later model. I had to get AAA to jump it.  Then my 2005 Caddy CTS when into Thirf Lock this drained the battery. My garage guy came to the house and easily jump the car with the unit he replaces the bad battery. Everything seems fine.  Again this unit did nothing. The car again when in the lock and again this unit told me the battery is dead but would not start the car. I used my old B&D Jumper unit, which at least told me the battery has a connection and juice, but would not start the car. At least I unlocked the gearbox so the car could be toll  I can't understand why this unit did not do the job. I follow the instruction."
5,The best customer service anyone can ever have. I highly recommend this company.,2021/7/22," Several weeks ago I sent in a review, pretty upset about the Hulkman jump starter I know things happen and it's not their fault for an electronic device to fail. Hulkman read my review on how I had an issue with their product. They made contact with me as soon as they seen what I had written about their product. These people are AMAZING. They went ahead and took care of my issue with the jump pack and sent me another. Well today I got to use the Hulkman and guess what this product is wonderful on the first try my vehicle started right up. I am very happy with my new Hulkman Battery Pack. I highly recommend this Jump Starter it is absolutely fantastic. Its easy to use and the best part that its portable. My friend said that things not going to work and wahala to his surprise it sure did work like it should gave. He was impressed. He will now be ordering one after I had proved to him that this HULKMAN Worked great. Thank you Hulkman Representatives your an awesome team. You sure do know how to take care of your customers. I will be ordering the hard case to add more protection so when I have it in my tool box it is not just laying in their getting all scratched up. Thank you Thank you Thank you!!"
3,"Great Jump Pack, Not So Great DC Source",2022/2/15,"The capacity, charge rate, and general jump pack capability of this unit is great.  It is easy to use, has the ability to be cycled on for 30 seconds without any connection to a battery (a key feature if you have ever had to jump a battery that has drained entirely), and has a well built case and interface.The DC output though, is somewhat problematic if you have devices that sense over-voltage past 15v and will not power on.  I had planned on using this Hulkman 85 as a jump pack and as a power source for small inverter.  The DC output (cig lighter adapter) is the same voltage as the jump start leads, which is about 16vdc.  The ""smart"" inverter will not power on.  This probably isn't a problem for simple devices like portable air compressors that don't sense voltage but I imagine there are plenty of devices that do which renders the DC output useless."
5,Super easy to use jumped a dead AGM battery,2022/4/28,"My 2015 Genesis 3.8L Sedan runs a bigger AGM battery.
I hadn't driven it for a few weeks and the 7 year old battery is on its way out.
First time it was completely unable to turn over though.
.
Plugged the hulkman into the + and grounded it.
It said ""ready"" so I tried it right away and no joy.
.
Waited about 5 minutes and it kicked over (barely)
.
Had I waited 10 minutes I'm sure it wouldn't have turned in slow motion lol.
.
But regardless, it was able to turn it over which is all I care about.
Being that I have a few trickle chargers, I'll use those at home and keep the hulkman in the car.
.
It's also helped me limp along a 99 miata with a bad alternator.
.
The extra flashy red light is nice to help make people aware of a stalled vehicle.
Flashy lights save lives.
.
Def recommend this jump starter :)"
5,Great product,2021/5/21,"My old van developed an intermittent short related to one of the sliding doors. It drains the battery overnight.
The problem is expensive to fix and it stops occurring if we don't use that door. But we forget from time to time and the battery gets drained.
Jumping the car was a breeze when the battery died last week.
I connected the 100% charged Hulkman with the self contained jumper cables, followed the instructions for dead battery, started the ignition and the van started at the first click with 93% of the charge remaining.
Now I am storing the small Hulkman in the van in case I do something stupid again like opening the defective door.
I think it will restart the car with a 93% charge. We hope."
4,Does what it’s supposed to do.,2021/8/3,A family member had a dead battery and was in need of a jump start so I decided to do my own product comparison. I first tried my fully charged full size jump starter and it would barely turn the engine over. Then I hooked the car up to my new Hulkman and the car cranked as if it had a new battery. Sometimes good things do come in small packages.
5,Works great!,2022/3/18,"I have been dealing with a parasitic power draw for weeks now since a series of micro trips and 5F. temps killed the battery. Still trying to trace it, and having used all my AAA free starts, I started looking for an inexpensive unit similar to what they were using to start the beast.

I bought this hoping that there would be no need for it, but, this morning the car had just enough power to bring up lights and dings but not enough to start it. I opened the hood, pulled the Hulkman out and attached the cables to the battery. After about twenty seconds I tried the car and she roared to life. The Hulkman went from 100% battery to 96% battery.

Note: The manual states to attach the cables for (I think) up to five minutes, but I had a residual charge."
5,"Fast to charge, easy to use, works well",2022/4/9,"Got this to jump both of our cars, as the batteries had died from lack of use during quarantine. Worked perfectly on a Honda Fit and a Jeep Liberty. Included charger is super fast. Flashlight function is VERY bright. Device will warn you if you put the clamps on the wrong battery terminals, and will not activate until you correct it. Jumping the Jeeps 4 liter engine from completely dead used about 15% of the battery capacity. Steps for use, and status/error codes, are all printed on the back of the battery, which is SUPER helpful.

Input is done with the included fast charger (plugs into USB-C port). The USB-B and USB-C ports also output for charging things like your phone. Also includes a 12v car plug accessory in case you have items that plug directly into the car port for charging."
1,DID NOT WORK FOR ME!,2022/2/18,"Hulkman jump starter would NOT start my 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I tried several times, and it would not even turn it over, just click. I got out my old school jumper cables and jumped my Jeep from my old truck and it started right up and no hesitation. When I replaced my battery in my jeep, I connected Hulkman to my 12v memory saver using the cigarette lighter attachment and it was working OK. I changed my battery and went to disconnect my memory saver, but Hulkman had shut its self-off causing my Jeep to lose its memory. Since I had this jump starter for two months, I could not return it. Customer service was no help at all, and they would not give me my money back. Guess I'll just throw it up on the shelf and try to forget about it. The next one I buy will be ""JUMP & CARRY"".  JNC.Update:  Customer service and Amazon refunded all my money!  I am happily surprised!"
5,I’m very confused with the negative reviews,2022/2/18,"Bought this about a 3 weeks ago since my wife’s van battery died for some reason since I couldn’t find the jumper cables and I figured if this product works it could come in handy. Well folks, it does work well and it does come in very handy. It arrived next day and I hooked it up to her van, 2 seconds and the ready light came on, van started right up as if we had just installed a new battery in her van, drained the hulkman from 100% down to roughly 93%. Fast forward to 3 days later, low and behold she left her lights on and the battery in her van died again. Went and hooked up the hulk, but this time it started beeping and flashing. I was like, oh crap I don’t know what’s wrong, I flipped it over and there was the chart to show what the trouble code was that was flashing on the screen. Crap, it said the battery was DEAD. I though, dangit, guess she’s going to have to walk home from work and that will teach her to leave her headlights on. But then, at that very moment, I looked to the right of the trouble code on the back and saw “press both buttons to enter force start mode”. Well darn, guess she won’t be walking home. I pressed both buttons and was greeted once again with a beautiful green “Ready” on the screen. Told her to try starting the van and BAMMMM, not only did it start instantly but the extreme power delivered to the van set the factory alarm off.

So to finish off my story time rant, if you want a product that does exactly as intended and then some, you should definitely purchase this lightweight, very portable (compared to a jump box”, powerhouse. And heck, when your not charging vehicles just shove your usb c (or a) phone cable into it and power up any of your portable devices."
5,Hulkman Alpha85,2022/2/25,"I bought this Hulkman Alpha85 about two months ago and I already used it once to successfully jump start my car in a cold morning.  Initially, I followed the instructions to hook it up to my car battery but I couldn’t start my car despite the Alpha85 said it was ready for use.  I then used the force jump feature and my car started right away.  This was a little puzzling because according to the instructions, my car battery had at least 10% charge remaining and I should not have to force jump it.  It used about 10% of the charge on my Alpha85 but nevertheless it worked and it had plenty of juice left in case you need it again.  This Alpha85 and all the accessories are good quality products. I especially like the speed of the quick charger.  Very compact and handy to carry around in cold weather."
5,Reliable,2021/3/20,"Much better than others I've used.
I bought the Avapow 3000 and returned it for this.
The Avapow clips wouldn't connect to the remote battery terminals under the hood (BMW), consistently. This forced me to get out of my car repeatedly to secure them for a good connection.
The Hulkmaster has a readout that tells you it's ""ready"".
The Avapow has LED's (4) indicating state of charge. That's it.

I'm still on the 1st charge and while I can't say I've used it that much being that my car doesn't get driven more than two or three times a week, so never charges bc I'm on leave from work, I've never had it let me down after at least a dozen starts and still have over 30% charge left.

I like it."
5,Winter Self-Rescue,2021/2/28,"High quality details where you'd usually see corners cut. (I'd love to buy a couple extra of the USB C cords and throw out the pile of finicky garbage ones around the house. Clamps use a single sturdy piece of copper the full length of the lever. Port covers open easily and seal out moisture.

I used it to boost my phone/laptop battery a few times but was waiting to get a real world test.

Jumps a completely dead car in the winter - multiple times after stalling in the snow and ice. Did eventually have to wait for it to cool down before a final jump, but capacity display said it still had 40%.

I can't vouch for the engine size rating, but I'd recommend this over waiting for roadside assistance or lining up help with a jump."
5,State of the Art Design,2021/6/25,"I was absolutely floored as I unpacked this jump starter kit. The packaging is seriously on par with Apple computers, and the device itself oozes quality. It's amazing that Hulkman is selling this kit at the same price as competing jump starters while providing much more in quality and accessories. It even includes a wall charger and spare USB cable, both with a special velcro strap to help with wrapping their cords.

(The storage case in my photos is not included and is sold separately by Hulkman on Amazon. Although pricey, the case is just as wonderfully designed as the jump starter itself.)

I know this review may come across as too flattering, but this product is just that good. I don't often leave reviews for physical purchases on Amazon, but I felt this one deserved the effort.

For emergency devices like these, not having to use them is actually a good thing. But if/when the occasion arises, I'll update my review with its performance in the field."
5,One Beefy Jumpstart Kit,2021/5/3,"Love everything about this jump starter to be frank.  The digital readout of the charge, incredibly straight forward to use, the option to use as a battery pack to charge other devices and you can recharge it via your 120v wall outlet incredibly fast which is nice if you let it discharge and are in a hurry.  The ""dead"" battery mode, which you must press the two buttons to enter, really works.  I had a super dead battery... like no clicking even yet putting the Hulkman into this mode and the Nissan started the first time, no sweat.  That's impressive.  A bunch of other nice features like the lights and such, but if you need a jump starter that you can rely on to be there when you need it most, this gets my vote.The only thing I can say negatively about it is I wish they would have included a case.  I would have happily paid a little more for a hard case for storing it in my cargo hatch.  I just kept the original box and store it that way though that will obviously not hold up as long.  Just a suggestion, Hulkman!"
5,Everyone should have one for their car.,2021/10/4,"I ordered the Hulkman Alpha85 June 2021. I never opened it but placed it in my car until I had to use it to help others with their vehicles. The first time I opened it to use, it already was 75% charged.  We realized the starter was the problem with the first vehicle so the Hulkman wasn't of use then. Still, it was great to have on hand and the vehicle owner said he wants to get one.  A few days later,  a person was having car trouble at a store I was at; it was her battery.  We hooked up the Hulkman and the car started right up. Oh and it was still 73% charged when I used it the second time and it only went down one percent after second use.  I am definitely getting one for my daughter's car for the just in case. It is compact and very handy. I am so glad I bought this for emergencies; even if it's just to help others."
5,Works great.,2022/3/30,"I bought this because my Chrsyler vehicle is having some electrical issues most times it starts without any issues but every now and the battery runs down and it won't turn over.  I bought a battery maintainer and plug it in every night like it's a hybrid.  It still has starting issues sometimes.  I've now had to use this battery jumper 2 times to jump start the car and once to charge my phone.  When I was charging my phone that was at 53% and brought it up to about 90% but the jumper went from 100% to 76%.  I thought that I might have to return it because it used so much of the charge for my phone and how is it possobly going to jump start my car once let alone the 15-20 times that it says it can do.  Well I have to say that it not only has jumped my car 2 times but the first te it went from 100% to 98% and th second time from 98% to 97%.  I don't understand it but it works.  It is also super quick and easy.  Normally when I need to jump it with another car it takes a few minutes while being connected to the other car to charge my battery enough to turn the engine over.  I connected the jumper to the battery and it automatically turned on.  Less than 2 seconds later it said ""ready"" in green.  I rushed over to start the car thinking no way it worked that fast and it started right up immediately.  It works great and I'm so glad now that I have it to rely on.  The only thing I wish it had was a case or something better to keep it together."
5,So wonderful to have.,2021/12/30,"My hybrid car battery was dying, so while I was waiting on getting it into the shop, I bought this because it was needing jumped nearly everyday and the mechanic across the street from me that I was annoying when my husband wasn't home to jump me had a Snap-On one, but this was cheaper. So I took a chance with a cheaper version.

I used it the next day I got it, ""jumped"" my car in like 3 seconds, in fact I thought I wasn't doing it right because the ready light came on almost immediately, but I went from being unable to start my car to turning it on that quickly. Then after I got my battery replaced, a few weeks later, we were doing a Trunk or Treat and the people next to us left their lights on the whole 2 hours and their car wouldn't start--not a hybrid vehicle. I pulled out this jump box, and again, it said ready in like 3 seconds, they started their car. Then I used it a few days later to charge my phone while I was out.....it took far longer to charge my phone, I think that's crazy. I've jumped a car like 5 times now and 2 times I've used it to charge a phone and it's sat in the car for 3 months, and I think the power is down to like 82%, I've yet to recharge it. Love that it's easy with a real plug in, not some usb charging thing.

I will be getting my teens one for their cars when they start driving for their vehicle. Takes out the need to ever have to hunt down a stranger to jump a vehicle or charge a phone if they are out in the middle of nowhere."
5,It worked fine but figure out your setup before you need it!,2021/11/14,"I got this six months ago and I finally needed to use this for a dead battery. Highly recommended. Definitely keep this in your car instead of jumper cables. This is much easier and faster than having to jump from another car.

I also highly recommend figuring out how to set this up for your car BEFORE you need it. The clamps sometimes don't have a good place and sometimes spaces are tight so you should find good spots for clamping beforehand. Also, you need to figure where the Hulkman will sit so it doesn't slide around after you start your engine.

I was lucky to have a dead battery at home where I could use a multimeter to figure out good ground spots on my car. I wound up using an engine mount bolt on my alternator as a ground because there was no room for the Hulkman's clip on my battery's negative terminal. I thought I could get a ground on the car frame near the battery but it wasn't a good spot.

After I got a good hold for the negative clamp, the Hulkman took a few seconds to give me ""READY"" and my car started on the first try. The start was like normal and not a weak hesitation start even though my battery was down to 10V. There is no waiting a few minutes for your dead battery to charge like from a jump from another car. You just hook it up and start your car when the READY comes on.

The only downside is the instructions are a bit thin. When charging there is a speed charge indicator but other than that I'm not sure if the Hulkman is charging when plugged in to an outlet. The instructions don't explain what goes on when the Hulkman is being charged (e.g., does it charge while the display is off, or charge while the display is showing a percent that doesn't move, etc.?)."
5,This title gadget will not let you down.,2021/4/7,"The first weekend we had this - our neighbor needed to start their car- the battery was dead. I took this over to them and we hooked it up - the machine lit up green after about a minute and we had the owner try to start the car and it started right up. Then our riding lawn mower would not start - so we used it on the battery- hooked it up - wait for green light - turn the key - starts right up.  Our travel trailer was dead - so we jumped that battery and se were able to have lights and a refrigerator operable. In one weekend, we were able to help in three different situations. We will order two more of these for a second vehicle and our RV.  These will be great Christmas presents for every one on our list."
4,where have i been,2022/5/24,"Car battery dead in driveway.  I hate the whole process of jumper cables.  Getting a second car, don’t touch cable ends, watch fan belt!, get good ground,  sparks, get good ground, do i run the second car, press accelerator,  acch still not starting, readjust,  no sparking, watch fan belt!  Maybe i need new cables.  Car totally dead.  Nothing. Was searching for new cables.  Figured amazon could 1 day deliver, and cheaper than calling a tow truck.  Then I saw these things.  Hulkman.  Cheesy name.  But not much more expensive than good set of cables.  Took a chance, figured I could always return.Long story short.  extremely well made.  well packaged too.  small, fits in glove box.  yes it looks like something apple would sell.  except for the name.  even came with its battery already charged.  didnt think it would work.  too small.  but attached its small clamps to my batterry terminal.  hit on button on hulkman (if battery comepletely dead like mine have to hit two buttons).  got back in car, lights are on, hit start button.  done.  car starts. no problem.  complete operation maybe a minute.  wow.Yes these are very good.  I took car to a mechanic to check alternator.  I bragged about how i got car to start with this hulkman and did not need jumper cables, feeling  like the tech nerd showing off the latest new iphone, expecting him to want to look at it.  He nodded, no need to look at.  Said they’ve been using these for a while...."
3,This Jumper is pretty good But.....,2022/4/29,"Dont get me wrong. this charger/jump pack is one of the better packs out there. My only greif is i bought it for a scooter that i have been working on restoring, rebuilding, and Modifying. There fore, I require many jumps consecutively. This pack in the first week was  the most amazing every. way more powerful than the tiny battery i purchase for the scooter. The following week it started acting like a jerk. Damn thing, if i tried to turn the engine over once with no start, then try again to start. It will go into fault mode and wont supply any power for 10minutes. arg!!? whats up with that? So, lets say i forgot to attach the spark plug boot. so i turn it over, oh shoot i forgot to connect the plug. whoops. lean over connect the plug and attempt to start again. NOPE says Hulk-man. you wait. and you wait and you wait. 10 mins takes forever when you are standing there waiting. This thing is awesome, only if your vehicle starts on the first turn. usually if you are jumping a vehicle, and you battery is dead. most cars with a dead battery are going to need a second run at it. if you are reading this you know what im talking bout. good luck"
5,Buy this one with confidence !!,2022/2/10,"My battery went dead and called AAA to start me back up.
They used this very booster and I couldn't believe it... He told me they used several different brands and this is the model all the guys rave about and he's boosting trucks and cars of all shapes and sizes several times a day .
I bought it and was impressed to say the least. Even the packaging was incredible plus the fact I can use it connected to my OB port to keep my electronics hot while I unhook the battery is just a bonus. ( You do need to buy a port adapter for that but it's cheap.)
It came with 72 percent charge and 8 minutes later it was 100 percent.
Everything in the box was maticulously placed and I appreciated that .
I've used it twice since then and each start will bring you down about 4 percent.
AAA beats this all day and night and tops it off during down time.
It is good for 10,000 boosts .
Big bright numbers and info make it fool proof and it also has a cigarette lighter style receprical for other accessories along with using it as a laptop or iPad back up for the kids in the back during road trips or just recharging your phone several times .
Some complain about no carrying case ...that's fine with me.
I keep it and the jumpers and everything else in a heavy duty canvas bag in my trunk and open it under the the hood . Haven't used the light in it yet but it looks like a bright LED that will light up what you need to see at night .
It's a huge peace of mind and even though I paid more than some do on cheaper models , I know it will not fail me when I need it most.
I also give back to those needing a jump that always helped me .
Today's electronics are very sensitive to onboard computers and this will give more power with no danger of jump starting it from another car , not to mention if the person is parked in a way that the cables are too short to reach .
Portable power s the answer.
I love it this thing ...5 stars Plus ."
5,This is a must to have,2022/3/21,"I had my SUV sitting for weeks without driving it during the winter and when I tried to start it, it couldn't because the battery was dead. I tried to jump start it using my 1200 Amp Schumacher power bank as before but it could not get the vehicle started. After fully charging the Schumacher power bank  (which takes hours)  and several unnsuccessful attempts to jump start, I gave up and thought to either have the vehicle towed or search for an alternative jump start. I decided to gobwith thevlatter and searched around in the internet and found this charm. I placed my order and had it delivered the next day. It arrived and without waiting (it arrived with 79% charge), I followed its simple, easy and straight forward instruction and voila! My SUV started without any hesitancy at the first attempt!I highly recommend this to any car owner! Don't be fooled by its apparent small size (which is a plus for storage and carrying), it is a beast and powerful."
1,It doesn't work,2021/11/6,This jump starter doesn't work. I have a 3.0L V6 engine and it doesn't work on my car at all. I was stranded and had to get someone who was kind enough to jump my car. I also tried using the cigarette lighter adapter to power my portable vacuum cleaner. It does not work either. The only thing is works is functioning as a big power bank to power my phone. Otherwise it's useless. Will be returning for refund.
5,What a lifesaver,2022/4/19,"I am so glad that I purchased this product. I decided to buy this brand because I saw great reviews on YouTube. I received the unit, and it was charged to 85%. I plugged the charger and in about 15 minutes it was fully charged. I was thinking I hope it works because I had no way to test it. Since I retired, I don't use my car that often anymore and, in the past, I went too long without using the car and my battery was weak and I had to get a jump from my wife's car. Well, three days after I got this unit, I went to use my car and the battery was weak again. I got the unit and I thought ""I hope this works"". I connected it to my battery, and I got the ready light right away. I pressed the start button on the car, and it started immediately as if the car battery was fully charged. The unit was still 95% charged after starting my car. Right there I was so thankful that I purchased this unit knowing that if I ever have this problem again, I won't need to bother anybody for a jump. I would recommend this product with confidence knowing that anybody will be as satisfied as I am owning this product."
5,Started a GMC Terrain w/completely dead battery instantly,2021/9/29,"It came 70% charged so I could have used it as soon as I opened the box but I decided to fully charge it, which only took about 15 minutes. The battery in my wife's car was completely dead and would not charge at all, but I was able to attach this unit and start it immediately and take it up to get the battery replaced. It's a bit confusing on what to do on a completely dead battery: you have to first attach it to your dead battery & then hold both the power button & LED button down at the same time for 3 or 4 seconds until a green display shows ""READY"". I then simply turned the key & the car started immediately. It showed that it used about 10% of the Hulkman charge to start the car, so I'm very impressed. This will be in my wife's car, fully charged and ready to go at all times. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with any kind of simple bag or carrying case for storage, which is necessary since it comes with the charger, cables, etc. They want 1/3rd of the original price of the Hulkman on Amazon for the case, which is a bit much for a fifty-cent plastic box."
5,Powerful Battery Jumper,2021/5/13,"This is a must-have! I had a lot of problems with my battery not starting when the temperature would drop to 30 degrees or less during the winter months. I decided to get this because I was tired of trying to find someone to jump my vehicle. Well of course after I got it it was like I didn't even need it but lo and behold my son ended up taking my car to work the other day and it just so happened to be cold when he got off that night and sure enough, the car wouldn't start. He said he plugged it up, placed the clamps on the terminals, the power pack said ready, and when he turned over the key, he said it was like the battery had never died. He was thoroughly impressed. You just don't want to be caught without one of these and have to depend on trying to find someone to jumpstart you and that's if they even have cables or worse, having to call your insurance company and waiting for them to send someone out to jump it for you. I never got into those big bulky jumper cables because they just got in the way, so this is a perfect alternative until I do something about the battery."
5,It really works,2021/7/3,"I took it right out of the box and it showed charge at 66% level.
I went out to my daughter's Toyota yaris which the battery was flat dead , not any lights would come on in the dash with key turned to on.
When I connected to car battery it gave me a warning ⚠️ light which you have to override by pushing and holding down both buttons for a few seconds and then it said ready.
I cranked car and it started and shut off like 3 seconds later , I had to Override by holding both buttons till device was ready again, I cranked car again this time giving it some gas because car hasn't run for several months.
*The device only lost 3% of charge in cranking the car twice.
I put device on charger and was amazed how fast it charged from 63% to 100% charge.
I don't know long term how it would hold up but this thing is awesome right now.
I will never travel anywhere without it now , I had been stuck before with no one around to jump me so my jumper cables were useless .
*Update, I have used this also to start my truck several times and it really is amazing how quickly it starts you vehicle and it only uses like 3% of charge at each start and its so fast at recharging it blows me away."
5,Highly recommend! Anyone can use this easily.,2021/2/20,"Wow is all I can say. We have had 20 degree weather for weeks in upstate NY. I purchased this after the battery in my car refused to start. For the record the car was in my garage with a full tank of gas. I had driven it the day before. The car is two years old and only has 17k miles in it. My brother in law came over with a similar machine and got the car started in under six minutes. I went in Amazon and bought this device hoping I’d never need it.
This morning I went out same circumstances and my car battery was dead.
I grabbed this device and after figuring out how to raise the hood, I had it started in less than two minutes! Got to our appointment 1 minute late. Could not have been happier.
Nice to have help at your fingertips."
4,A Heavy-duty charger with inadequate instructions,2021/8/2,"I purchased this charger for its high mAh rating to start my wife's Camry hybrid after a lengthy period of non-use.  Other chargers had failed and I hoped this would work.  It did but only after many failed attempts.The instructions for this charger are quite elemental and do not cover unusual situations and, as a result, I came very close to returning this device.  However, after searching for more info online and I discovered that, in fact, this charger has an undocumented way of using it when the charger doesn't ""see"" the battery at all.  This hidden trick allowed me to successfully restart the Camry.  I give the charger high marks.  I give their instruction manual low marks."
5,"This thing is STRONG, so far.  Love the compact size and power.",2021/12/22,"My old style jump box just kept getting weaker, so I finally decided to try one of the new style Lithium ones.  It has not disappointed.  Left the lights on in the car the other night, and the battery was dead dead dead.  Had to push both buttons to get this jumper to recognize that there was a battery connected, it was so bad.  Turned the key, and she started right up!  This thing is way stronger than my big jump box ever was.  Impressive.As long as it lasts, I will be extremely happy with this purchase."
3,This thing is Huge,2021/11/15,"If i would’ve taken a closer look, pictures are deceiving on ads, i would not have bought this.. it is Big.. real Big.. Like SemiTruck equipment big..

This is Not one of those “that’s going to start your car?” kinda jump units, oh no this is almost like carrying around one of those old Lead Acid jumpboxes from Diehard..

Only opened it up and held it, haven’t needed to use it yet, we don’t have any truck stops around here to jump Semi Trucks.."
5,Saved us and a couple of strangers!,2021/9/28,"My husband ordered this because our car battery kept dying. I was skeptical, but he was excited about it.

IT WORKS!

We took it on vacation and saved a few stranded strangers with dead batteries! One car was parked in a lot and no one could get close enough to connect jumper cables and the other was on the side of an extremely busy 2 lane road in Glacier National Park.

He hooked this baby up and their cars started instantly! One guy wanted to buy it from us!

This is a tool that you won’t use often, but when you need you’ll be glad you have it!

You do not need another car battery for a jump. All you need is this contraption! It comes with all the plugs and adapters to charge it and use it right out of the box. Comes in a sturdy box we use for storing it in.

Great unique, useful gift for anyone!"
5,Peace of mind + portable power for USB / Cigarette lighter devices,2021/2/28,"I bought this for the peace of mind in case I'm ever in the unfortunate scenario of a dead car battery.  I haven't needed to jump my car yet, but I walked through the steps so I know how to use it if the time comes.  It wasn't difficult at all. The screen is easy to read and a green ""ready"" light let's you know you've connected it properly.I've also used it as a portable power pack.  Two full iphone charges brought it to around 50%, then I used the cigarette adapter to power a tire pump.  Adding about 5 PSI to 8 tires still left me with about 25%.  Finally, I powered a handheld car vacuum for about 15-20 minutes until it hit 0% and powered off.  The only device that didn't run well was my portable DC/AC inverter.  It thought the input (normally a car) had a low battery and wouldn't power it's 120V outlet.  Not really a big deal, but would have been cool if it worked.I did try to help jump a car that stalled at a traffic light, but the ""ready"" light never came on.  This had us suspect there was another issue with the car, like a bad battery connection.  I didn't know the person and they eventually were towed, so I'll never know what was wrong."
5,Worked as advertised,2022/3/21,I bought this recently to have in case I needed a jump and had an opportunity to use when a coworker’s battery died. It worked as advertised and supplied plenty of power. I like that it has a large display to let one know the percentage of charge left and a green ready display to let you know when to jump. It held it charge since I first received it and I had an occasion to charge my phone with it. The charge time is fast! The built-in lights on the unit helped since we were in a darkened garage. Seemed high quality build. Highly recommend.
1,Did not work for me.,2022/1/19,"Charged it. Hooked it to car and it started. Unfortunately, the car then stopped dead. Almost like someone had ripped off the distributor cap. Tried it several times all with the same result. It was confusing because you normally only need to jump the car and once started, you are good so I do not understand why the device shutdown and took the running engine with it.  I gave up, called AAA. They jump started the car in seconds and it ran fine. That AAA was able to do it with no issues told me the car was fine and there is something wrong with this item. Returned it."
5,Need a jump starter! Get this!,2021/11/24,"As a disclaimer I have yet to use this, but this was by far one of the best unboxing experiences I’ve had in a while. The attention to detail they have put in the packaging makes me believe the company really cares for quality. The starter itself feels extremely sturdy and it is exactly as described. Flashlight is pretty bright and the little charge that it needed was very quick. If you are not sure on which starter to get, Id recommend this one!

Edit: Needed to jump start my bike and this worked without any issues!"
4,Use as a 12 volt power supply,2022/3/9,"I purchased the battery for use as a 12 volt source for a 12 volt LED light whip on my trike, so I have not yet tried it out for its intended purpose of starting a car with a dead battery, and cannot comment.  However, if my calculations are correct, the light whip I use at its brightest setting is about 2 amps of draw.  I had hoped to get 10 hours (20000 mAh = 20 Amp) from the battery.  My projections from some trials show I will be lucky to get 5 hours of runtime.  I want to be fair in that I have not actually measured the amp draw in real time as I do not have the instrumentation to do so - I am using data found on the internet for the brand of light whip I am using.I do believe the unit is ruggedly built, and the cables are robust.  I like the fact that you do not have a relay box hanging from the cables as that function is integrated into the housing of the unit, making the unit less awkward to handle.  Look to other reviews that talk about it starting ability and capacity."
5,Worked when I needed it,2022/3/14,"I charged it up and left it in the car for months. Just used it this morning.

Take off half a star for it taking ten minutes to throw off the, ""Error 2,"" signal. Looked at the instructions and it said to hold down the power and led buttons for two seconds while connected to the car battery. Worked perfectly.

Error 2 means that the batter is dead. No crap, I knew it was dead. It took quite a while to tell me that I needed the workaround setting for Error 2. Once I turned it to the ""Error 2 Setting,"" the charger worked instantly. I'll only ever run into this issue once though, so I don't feel justified taking off a full star. Would have appreciated clearer instructions or displays, so I didn't sit there like a silly goose for 10 minutes.

About 4-5 months sitting in the car the charger was still at %100. So definitely close enough to 5 stars."
2,Not a sure thing,2022/2/6,"I used this on my brother's 5.3 Silverado with a completely dead battery where jumper cables didn't even work and it started it. Battery actually turned out to bad. But it started it still, multiple times.

But when I went to use on my 5.7l Silverado it would not start it. So this lead my to think it was something else

After spending money and it still not starting I finally pulled the battery & connected the jump box directly to the terminals, still nothing.

So I had the battery tested & found out it was bad. Put new battery in and it starts just like that.

So this jump box does not fully work.

Wish I could get my money back or something. Was gonna purchase one for every vehicle but dang."
2,"If u life may hang in the balance, this isn’t for u",2021/8/5,"It’s a very nice pack, definitely well thought out..etc it’s down fall is that it’s trying to hard, so I got it to jump the car that doesnt get driven enough and the generator battery cause it tends to die. Well this would do neither. The gen needs u to crank it a few times to get fuel into the carbs, this decided after 4 cranks it was time to rest for 20min so it had a error 2 code (too many attempts), next day I try on the car, the battery is a few weeks old and was disconnected, I hooked it up after connecting the battery and it does “nothing” code #4 battery is dead? Well thanks for the update but isn’t this to jump a dead battery??? So finally I had to charge my black N crapper and it jumped both successfully & I printed the return code for this. I found one similar that will jump a dead battery and is less like a ATM. I want something that i can count on in the worst of conditions"

5,It worked!,2021/11/5,This started my riding lawn mower with  Briggs and Stratton intek 15.5 hp with a dead battery. Got me going again! It works every time.
5,Genial,2021/2/8,Muy bueno
5,My wife loves it,2021/12/29,"Purchased for my wife, easy to use & store, lightweight (not lead battery). Many safety features guide you to proper connections. This one, I like. Thank you"
5,Goid,2021/10/30,What we really need
5,This is a lifesaver. I love this item.,2021/12/15,I recommend this item. Every household should have this item. Save time and money.
5,I honestly wasn't expecting much.,2022/4/30,"As the title states, my expectations were rather low.  Unit was 87% charged and was fully charged within 20 minutes of charging.  I had a near completely dead battery in my tow vehicle.  It was past the point of even clicking. I connected the Alpha 85 and once it said it was ready I gave the key a bump. Just clicks.  ""I figured as much"", I thought to myself.  I waited a few second and gave it another try. the 7.4L (454) turned over and fired up like I had just installed a new battery. Absolutely no hesitation.  Since I don't seem to be driving this vehicle very often given the current gas prices, and I also can't keep it on a battery tender, this seems to be a perfect solution."
5,This thing is a beast.,2022/2/26,"First off I would like to say that my first impressions, had left me a little upset as it did not work.
It totally changed my mind as I've had it for about a month now!
The build quality is phenomenal, it's heavy, rugged and although you don't want to drop it, it does feel like it can a take a drop or two but I highly recommend getting the hard shell case they offer to pair with this.
So I initially bought this for my 2013 dodge Challenger, it's been heavily modified including a aftermarket battery that needs to be on a tether charger so battery will die in about a week of no use.
I allowed the battery to die and when I first used the hulkman as I said it was not able to start the car, it would turn on briefly then die. I was upset obviously but decided to try another day.
Anyone that owns a challenger knows that the actual battery is in the trunk, but majority of the time we use the fuse box in engine compartment for any type of work or when jumping the car (which is what I did the first day). The second day I connected the hulkman to the actual battery in the trunk and boom started up no issues, and since then I have jumped my challenger (6.2L) 3 times and battery on the hulkman went from 100% to 80% as it seems it drains 3-5% per attempt. In short this little portable device is a monster, just make sure it's connected to the main battery."
5,Works great!,2021/12/26,Works great
4,Cranked two Crusader 454cid and one 4.107 Perkins,2021/7/22,"Update: surviving well, but I like the longer cables of NOCO units on the job.
Stayed within 89% after rotating two Crusader 454cid engines and one Perkins 4.107.

One attempt capacity of the unit.

325i AGM battery that is only a few months old, but I accidently activated the side marker illumination.
""2 !"" indicated a dead battery, hold both buttons to initiate force charge.

This unit did what it was supposed to do, then dropped to 69%. It did not have enough capacity to repeat start a few minutes later. I walk home, recharge, repeat and all was fine. Handy men in the neighborhood had the phone ready to call the police on me, gotta impress the clientele, but I heard one say ""lithium pack""! So, if one of those guys, who buy cheap junk at autoparts stores knows what this pack is, I think I want my money back."
5,Used 1 time it worked,2021/11/16,"Had my doubts when I needed to jump start daughters 4.6 v8 truck. the battery was stone dead after sitting for 6 months. When I first connected the booster nothing not click or a blink, pushed power and light buttons together and viola trucks horn sounded, headlights came on, hit the starter it cranked over about 2 seconds and started right up.
After use jumper battery still showed 96% charge. So after past experience much larger lead acid booster I am very impressed with this booster and recommend it highly."
5,More heavy duty than it looks,2022/3/26,"When I opened the box, I was impressed from the start. This Hulkman jump starter is heavier than it looks in the photos, and the cables are a heavier gauge than they look. It arrived with 72% charge, so I plugged it in with the included wall adapter. It reached full capacity in only a few minutes. Nice! I was able to try it out on a large ATV with a dead battery. It is extremely easy to use. I just plugged in the cable with the clamps and attached them to the battery. The “Ready” light quickly lit up. I pressed the start button and it started effortlessly. Before using the jump starter, it wouldn’t even crank; it only clicked. After starting it, the battery in the jump starter still had 97% remaining. I’m keeping it in my car in case I need it, and I feel very confident that it will be able to start my car if I ever have a dead battery. Very satisfied."
5,All around amazing,2022/1/20,"This jump starter is nothing short of amazing.  From the moment you begin opening the box you can just tell that what’s inside is going to be incredible.  I compare it to Apple’s packaging.  Everything is perfect, all the accessories are solid, nothing feels or looks flimsy.  All openings are the charger have waterproof covers, the battery clams are big and beefy and really grip the battery posts.  Super easy to use, clear instructions.  The information screen is bright and crystal clear. I must say this product is probably one of the top 10 high quality products that I’ve ever purchased. Fully Charging the battery pack is lightning fast. I’m thrilled with this product and that does not happen often with me."
5,Great product that just proved its worth,2022/1/25,"Finally decided to spend the money and get one of these battery powered jump starters after my battery died in the middle of a school car-line.  I purchased the unit at the end of October, charged it up, and threw it in the truck of the car.  It's now the end of January and haven't touched it until today.  A fellow car-line prisoner's battery died and I couldn't have been more excited to try out this product and return the favor.  I took all the packaging off, plug it up to the battery, then nothing!!  I guess the battery was COMPLETELY dead.  In that case, I held the two buttons down together until it said ""Ready"".  The guy turned the key and the car started right up.  Afterwards, the product still had 92% charge left.  Really pleased with this thing.  I would highly recommend it.  Sucks to spend the money when you don't immediately need it, but when you do need it, its very convenient."
5,Very nice jump starter compared to my previous one.,2022/4/28,"It seems a lot of companies are jumping on the bandwagon for portable jump starters. My first one was an Everstart and it's still doing its job. I still have it in my car. I bought this for my wife's vehicle. I bought a different brand before this one, and it was faulty right out of the box. The light wouldn't turn on. So I decided to go with this brand. It's a bit beefy, but it has a really nice display and it worked right out of the box. I have it tucked away in the spare tire storage area of my wife's Honda CR-V. You can buy a hard case for it, but I decided to go with a cloth material since her CR-V has limited space in the spare tire area."
5,Doesn't work [update],2022/2/8,"[Update] to turn it on press both bottoms until it says ready, user error this is actually a very good product.

A month ago I went on a family trip just to come back with a dead battery. I replaced the battery for a new and my truck battery went dead again because of what I believe is a parasitic drain problem. I bought another jump starter but that thing sucked so I returned it and bought the Hulkman. It arrived today just in time because tomorrow my son has a medical appointment, charged it and this thing doesn't jump start my truck at 100% battery. Light works, usb and usb-c ports works but the thing that I really need it just didn't work. I guess I was the unlucky one, will be returning this unit."
5,First use was on big dump truck,2022/1/1,Bought this about a month ago but first used it last night. Had a dead battery on our old ford dump truck (gas not diesel). Using the force mode it started immediately with this device. Of course it was night time and 20F outside at the time. Flashlight function was extremely nice to have. We ended up having to use it three times since we kept managing to stall the truck trying to get it unstuck. This device was unfazed and still had 70% charge left afterward. Needless to say I was really impressed. Ordered another one after giving the first one to my buddy to keep. Charges fast via the DC plug that is included with it. I bought a case for it but the original box it ships in is really not bad for long term storage.
5,"This is an awesome product and once you own one, you wont want anything else",2022/2/26,"I am below average when it comes to mechanical things.  This device is simple to use and has the 3 steps in simple diagrams (connect the clamps, plug into the hulkman, and power it up).  I had the 4th step which is to start your car.  My battery was dead, so the device required me to press the power and led button together.  It simply cant get easier and there is no spark.  I did it today in less than 2 minutes.  This is an awesome product."
5,Retains Charge and Operative at -40C/F,2022/2/4,"I live in northern Michigan.  Recently purchased the Hulkman Alpha85 Jump Starter.  In contrast to some prior reviews, I want to clarify that according to the manufacturer's instructions, this device is operative at -40 deg C/F.  The device arrived with 80% charge.  Took only 5 minutes to reach 100% charge.  I recently took a trip and left my car at the airport for three weeks in below zero weather.  On my return, the Hulkman still retained 100% charge!!"
5,Awesome and Functional,2022/4/23,"I have lent this out to a neighboor three times to start their 5.8 liter truck and it never came back with any complaints or scratches. I havent need it yet for a jump but it lives under the seat in the car where it can get hot and has no problem holding a charge. I have used it several times to charge phones in a jam and thrice now to charge a 16 inch MacBook pro. It doesnt really like to do it because the power output is t enough to use and charge, mostly just plugin and slow the drain. I had to do this once for work but made it the better part of a full day using no wall power. My computer and the battery were about 50% before I finally gave in and purchased a wall adapter. The only ones available at the Apple Store were 30watt and did nearly the same thing except it would also charge VERY slowly, like 1 hour to add 5-10% to the laptop battery. All this is to say, its useful in a pinch for more than just jumping cars but keep that to yourself or it will disappear when you need it most."
5,Starts My 6.7 right up,2021/9/12,"Shortly after I purchased this, one of the batteries in my truck went bad. So I was jump starting it daily until I took care of the battery. Went about a week jumping it. Super simple and super easy. I probably got about 10 or so jump starts out of a single charge. Very impressed with this product.

The only thing I’d like to see them add or offer is a small carrying bag. The box it comes in is not practical to carry around. Its a process to open the box it comes in so I don’t keep it in that either."
5,Great battery pack,2021/6/19,"This thing is very powerful. My ex couldn't get her car to jump start with traditional cables after 20 minutes. I came out with the Hulkman and connected it and the car fired right up. I've used this on my daughter's car and one of my completely dead tractor batteries and it fires it up every time on the first crank. Love the power, reliability and convenience of this so much I got one for my daughter and showed her how to use it so I don't have to worry about her getting stuck somewhere if her battery suddenly goes dead. Today's batteries typically don't give you a warning. One day you go to start it and the battery is just dead. Great to have this in your vehicle just in case."
5,5star,2021/4/21,I am a car dealer and this is the best jump box I have used. Turns over every car instantly and takes less than 5 percent of battery to start each car. I have jumped 10 vehicles in the past 2days at auctions and battery is still at 70 percent.Very sturdy and simple design. Only been using a month but extremely impressed. Replaced my $300 oem jump pack from autozone which was complete junk. The Oem one from autozone caught on fire so they gave me a new one. The new replacement one autozone gave me came apart a week after I got it. It wasn't even worth getting another free replacement. This hulkman is built sturdy and has instant turnover .5star with the price
5,"Highly Portable, Minimalist Elagance, Functional and Easy to Use",2021/9/14,"I bought this because I needed to jump my Prius after my catalytic converter was stolen. I had to move my car every few days because I live in the city (street sweeping, etc) and using my girlfriends car to jumpstart the Prius was really not feasible.

I looked at a bunch of different portable jump packs and this was my top pick for my budget and what I was looking for.

I wanted something that had enough power to jump start my car, was reliable, easy to read/use, and compact/portable (easy to carry and store).

This delivered on all fronts. You have to read the directions. I had to use force start function after attaching to my battery and it started on the first time, every time (well I had to jump my electrical panel under the hood to unlock the trunk and then attach to the battery in the trunk of the Prius and jump the battery).

This was working great until around the 8th jump that I needed (after 3 weeks ish). I reached out to customer service and they were amazing. They were easy to contact were in constant communication and followed up when they hadn’t heard from me in a couple days.

Not only did they replace my Alpha85 but after hearing of how I had to start the car they gave me a free upgrade to their Alpha100!!! They wanted to make sure I had the best product in their line after hearing of what I had to do to jumpstart the Prius.

Hulkman really cares about their customers and stands behind their products. I had bought a protective case for the Alpha85 as well and was thinking of getting one for the replacement Hulkman was sending since the Alpha100 is slightly larger but Hulkman blew me away and already sent one out knowing that I ordered the case for the Alpha85!!! I didn’t even ask or mention it in my contact with them. They just knew from my order # and anticipated my needs. They went waaaay above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience and showed me not only how much they stand behind their products but how much they value their customers.

You got a lifelong supporter here Hulkman. I will buy your products for my automotive needs every time. Thank You!!!"
5,Lifesaver,2022/1/7,This is perfect haven’t driven for a month went to start my car and my car didn’t start read review’s on tons of different jumps starters this one was decent priced and had prime delivery I got the next day it came charged at 80% I went and followed the directions and it started my car with no issues. so far this did as promised before I even had to charge it so much easier than having to hook up to a car with traditional jumper cables only thing that would make this better is the cables being longer but they are good enough for my Corolla I would recommend it took only 10% leaving 70% to use another time and since I’m not driving all the time thanks to the pandemic this little battery does what I need!
3,Excellent but make sure you know what Default codes one and two and three mean,2022/1/28,I thought the instructions were OK I wish there was more emphasis on the understanding what a fault code means when it appears. People think you just hook it up and jumpstart your car but you need to understand what the boost potential is if you’ve got a battery that is completely dead. Once I understood code 2 meant  and how to handle it …..it worked like a champ
4,Fantastic Customer Service,2021/6/26,"Terrible product would not start my 2014 Cadillac XTS with a 6 cylinder engine. JUNK!!! VERY UN HAPPY. IT WAS 100% charged and would not start my car. Had to jump my car with another car. Waste of money!,!

UPDATE. THE COMPANY SAW MY REVIEW AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT ME AND SENT ME A NEW CHARGER. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. VERY VERY IMPRESSED!!!!"
5,Rapid Charging,2022/4/13,"When the charger arrived, it was only at 82% but took less than 30 minutes to fully charge to 100%.  Might I offer a few suggestions.  The protective end cap should have a storage means so as not to get lost.  I added Velcro to the end cap and another place of the charger cables to affix the piece.  Also liked the Positive and Negative symbols on the jumper cables even though it was difficult to see.  I just took a Magic Marker and highlighted the Red Plus Sign on the red clamp.  While I don't know if weight has any bearing on quality, this is the heaviest Jumper Battery I have ever had other than old technology where the car jumper is the size of a small cooler."
5,Worked when it was needed.,2022/1/9,"I bought this for my daughter as she entered her first year at The Ohio State University last fall (2021). Just today, after she arrived on campus after Christmas break, she had to get a COVID test and wait in her car for a while for the results. Though she's embarrassed to admit it because she knows better, she left the key in the ignition long enough that it drained the battery and wouldn't start. A quick read of the directions, and she had the car started in 5 minutes. The Jump Starter's battery still showed 100% after being charged in the fall at the start of the first semester, so it obviously holds a charge well. After one jump start, it still read over 90%.  She'll charge it back to 100% when she gets to her dorm, and back it will go in the trunk, ready for next time."
1,Big disappointment,2022/2/14,"I have ordered this one which was priced way over than the other smallar booster batteries. But this one had the same day delivery which I was looking for to get my car running asap.
After charging the unit to 100%, I tried to jump start my Honda fit but ot did not work at all. My cars battery was dead and I tried to manual over ride many times but it did not provide sufficient energy to ignite the car.
I had to call geico, the guy came with a much smaller booster (noco boost plus gb40) and it was not even fully charged. Tried once and voila…it worked like charm. I am returning this one and getting the noco."
4,The booster you want to buy (but need a separate case for),2021/5/19,Holy smokes this thing is tough! It is extremely solidly built and heavy and comes with impressively durable clamps. I must say I would prefer to pay a little bit more to have it come with its own custom case rather than having to buy one. Seems a bit lame to skimp on that for such a well made booster.  Outstanding function.
5,Jump starts when other things fail,2022/2/4,"My battery died. I have a 4.0 6 cylinder and tried to jump start it with a 4 cylinder car. No luck. A Silverado 2500 HD tried to jump my vehicle and again no luck. Bought a 750 amp jump starter and it failed. Finally a neighbor with a very expensive SnapOn jump starter was able to get it going.

A few months later battery died again. I wanted to try something small with great reviews. I could always return it if it failed. I had NO faith this tiny box would get me going. Charged it overnight, put it on my dead battery, and it started immediately. Drove it around for 20 minutes and turned the vehicle off. Battery didn’t get a good charge so I popped the Hulkman back on and it worked like a champ.

I figured there’s no way my vehicle would start off such a small box, but I’m very happy and will keep it in my car from now on."
5,"Compact, easy to use",2022/2/24,Everything works well but the jump starter doesn't come with carry case.  Don't want to spend extra $35 for a OEM case.  I bought a cheap MTM single handgun case (13.1x9.7x3.2 inches) $10 to storage it.  Hard plastic with foam protection.  Put it in my trunk or carry it around as needed.
5,Best Jump Start battery on Amazon,2021/6/23,Rated at 20000mah/74Wh with 2000amp peak current to start any size engine.  Comes with very fast charging wall plug cable to quickly charge the unit.  Also has a USB and USB-C port for charging cell phones as well as a cigarette  lighter plug to plug in your mattress pump or whatever else uses the cigarette lighter style plug.  The display is large and easy to read.  The build quality is excellent.  I highly recommend this over the Noco brand which seems to have a really small internal battery that they don't ever tell you the size of as if they are hiding the small size.  It also seems like Noco dont provide a wall charger to charge the unit.  Trust me and buy this one :)
5,Useful Tool So Far,2022/5/17,"I bought this for long road trips as but so far, I haven't used it on my car yet. The reason I am giving such a great review though is that I have used it twice on my lawn mower battery and it is great. My old battery charger takes an hour to charge my mower battery before I can jump it - this charges in a couple seconds and I can start my mower. I will get around to replacing the battery eventually but for now, I absolutely love not having to drag extension cords all the way out to the garden shed. I have jumped the mower twice and I am still at about 80 percent on the unit so I think I could get at least 2 car jumps worth out of this unit."
5,Works Great!,2021/11/21,"Bought this two months ago, just used it today for the first time. My battery has side posts which are difficult to get to. The cables on this unit are long enough to make this relatively easy. Attached the cables, got the ready light, car started right up, no hesitation. Charger power went from 100% to 91% after starting the car. Plugged in the usb c charger and it was back to 100% in about two minutes. If I could give it 10 stars, I would."
5,UPDATED!,2022/3/2,"Just received my alpha85. At first glance it looks to be solid and well built. I like the large display and the fact that it says it can hold a charge for 18 months. What I don’t like is the fact that it includes the Alpha85 jumpstarter, jumper cables, wall charger, DC 12V cord, Type-C USB cable, but there’s no carrying case to keep everything together. Even the cheaper brands come with a carrying case.

Update: I’ve already used the Alpha85 several times, and it works flawlessly! My Police SUV was completely dead and something with all of the added electronics is constantly draining the battery, so I hooked up the Alpha85 and it started with the first turn of the key. Also, I was contacted by Hulkman customer service about my complaint of it not coming with a carrying case. They asked for my address and sent a carrying case within three days.

I’d definitely recommend the Hulkman Alpha85. The jumpstarter works great and the company’s customer service is amazing."
5,Starts a dead battery,2022/5/1,I've got a mustang ecoboost that drains the car battery overnight. Happens intermittently a couple times a year. I needed a portable battery jump starter that has an override to bypass the safety shutdown features. This is so it can start a drained dead battery as mine gets down to under 2V. On this unit it is called Force Start mode and it just worked like a charm. Very pleased with this device. The only complaint I have is that they sell a plastic case for $35 which is very high for a plastic box in my opinion. I'll just use the cardboard box that it came in for storage.
2,Can't even jump my motorcycle battery,2022/4/3,"Ok I'm not sure how this has 5 stars. Maybe I just received a lemon. But I assume QC checks things like this. I ordered this because I have a 7.0 L F350 and some motorcycles. I am always needimg a boost or to boost someone else. So I bought this in the hopes that it would be a positive review. But nope. It won't even jump my bike. I checked on a voltage meter and it is barely putting anything out. I read read and reread the manual. I'm doing everything right, but unfortunately it looks like this isn't as great a unit as they would have you believe. I never expected much from most of these random sellers items. But for the price I definitely expected better."
5,Best bang for the buck,2022/5/1,"Easy to use and it actually works. I have had to jump start my personal truck and also my f550 work truck over the course of owning this product and I can say without a doubt it actually works.  I’ve used it 3 times and the charge level barely depleted bellow 80%.  It has safety features that once you hook it to a battery with weak charge it will automatically apply voltage for jump starting, and if the battery is super dead like mine was once (wouldn’t even open the door locks) there is a button to override the safety to supply voltage anyways when the battery is too weak to allow it to function normally.  Which is great because other jump boxes leave that feature out and simply will not jump start a completely drained vehicle because it doesn’t sense enough voltage  to turn its self on.  Highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"Great Product, Great Value",2021/8/11,"Lightweight and doesn't take up much space. I still have mine in the box there is foam padding and a molded fit in the box for added protection, but there is a carry case available for it . I may buy the case in the future since it does have a molded for and handle for easy carrying. I love how sleek it looks and how fast it charges it came at about 80% and charged within a few minutes. The box says that if the jump starter is completely dead you can charge ut for 5 minutes and it will be enough to start your car. I definitely believe it. I like that it come with a separate USB-A to USB-C connector so I don't have to bring another cord to charge my phone. It also comes with a DC adapter like the cigarette lighter in your car and you can actually run an air compressor off of it or anything else that fits. It also have the simple instructions printed on the inside of the box on a removable piece as well as on the back of the unit. Very simple and user friendly unit and manual. BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. I have seen people on YouTube use this to start dead batteries that have been sitting for years.If you have the extra money you should definitely get it now before you need it and encourage your friends and family members. Everyone needs one."
4,Nice product,2021/5/15,"Looks like a great product, have not actually used it but will leave follow up. It is well made and solid, somewhat disappointed that an item as costly and nice as this does not come with a case. Even a cheap one, maybe a bag? I see they sell them extra. It looks somewhat portable and easy to use except you have to keep track of all the loose parts.
It needs a case!"
5,"Very intuitive, Started my car with a dead battery (3.2v)",2022/2/13,"My car sits for a week or 2 at a time, I got tired of dragging an extension cord across the yard to hook up a battery charger, and bought this jump box. It arrived with an 80 percent charge. I hooked it up to my battery and the car started right up within seconds. Even my professional battery charger took an hour or so to charge the battery enough to start. I am impressed and will be buying one to go in my truck and my girlfriends car. It also has provisions to charge cell phones and other devices through USB and USB-C. It also come with a 12v lighter socket. 10/10 worth the money. I also bought the Caseling GB70 storage case, that someone else mentioned here and it fits perfectly with extra space."
5,I'm a believer now!,2022/3/17,"I was doubtful about its ability to start a diesel engine even after watching several YouTube videos about how awesome it is. It had no problem getting a 6.0 powerstroke started on a 15 degree day (the truck batteries wouldn't crank the engine, only had enough juice to warm the glow plugs). After hooking it up and waiting about 30 seconds the charge level had dropped to 95% on the Hulkman....key on, glow plugs warmed up, cranked and started.....awesome, and the engine was stone cold (block heater wasn't plugged in). Like I said, I'm a believer now, this thing really works."
5,just amazing.,2022/3/3,"so far I'm speechless.
this tiny thing is starting every vehicle I throw at it, like it was nothing.
just incredible.
how someone is buying anything besides this device is beyond me.
I purchased this bulky unit from Home Depot for about the same price (before I bought this one) ...
charged it all night, just to get ONE start (barley) and the unit died!!!
this tiny device on the other hand, been without charge for two months, and I on the 5th start on my not completely dead battery on a vehicle I dont use, and im only at 80% battery... it has couple of dozens of easy starts left in it, WITHOUT CHARGE!!
absolutely great device so far."
1,Do NOT purchase,2021/11/7,"Extremely disappointed with this purchase.  The product charged or at least showed charged .  When it came time to actually jump start my vehicle, it did not work.  By that time , it was too late to return .  Giving this one star, just so they would post review."
5,Well-built and easy to use,2022/2/19,"It’s a nice unit, solid and sleek. I bought the 85, since the 85s was a longer delivery and I needed one right away. It came about 40% charged, so I charged it to 100% with the included fast charger. Including the charger is a nice touch, since I believe most of the other jump-starters only come with the cable but no “cube.” The car I had to start was dead and in a weird spot, so I didn’t want to fool around in the cold with jumper cables. I used the Hulkman and the whole process took maybe 15 seconds. You don’t even turn it on; just hook it up and turn the key. Afterward, the charge says 97% so it should be good for quite a few more starts before recharging."
5,LOOK NO FURTHER!! This is the BEST,2022/2/4,"I have an older BMW that is having problems starting. I don't drive it enough for one thing. I was having to ask for jumps a lot because my car wouldn't start. Now with this wonderful product, my car starts immediately and saves me the embarrassment of having to ask neighbors for a jump.  It charges to 100% well under 5 minutes, and really holds it's charge. This is a superior product. If you have a medium to large SUV or a heavy duty truck, don't buy anything else. This is a SUPERIOR PRODUCT and I highly recommend buying one. You can't go wrong! It's worth every penny and you will be glad you invested in this superior jumpstarter, every time you use it. whether rarely or often."
5,Impressive,2021/12/15,"The Battery on my Jeep started going bad. had to use this 5 times before i got the new Interstate AGM battery. Put this on, turn on the key and started right up, put it away... all less than 5 minutes ... maybe 7 ?
--- This morning a neighbor wanted to know if i could help jump start his 198something ford truck. It had been sitting several months and would not even groan. he had cables all hooked up ready to go. took them off, put this on, hit the start, one quick WHAT out of his starter then started right up. ... the rest was what he did leaving it sit several months."
5,Anxiously waiting...........  For someone's battery to fail.,2021/5/27,"I've always been a bit leary, ok afraid, of jump starting someone's vehicle off of mine or having mine jumped off of another vehicle.  Hulkman gives me the confidence to both jump myself and jump others.  Plus, not having to wait for AAA, WIN!!!This is extremely easy to use and it tells you when to jump start the car, almost like an AED (hahahaha) except it doesn't talk to you.  I am now actually waiting for someone at work to need help or for the spouses truck battery to die (happens somewhat regularly). I've never before bought a product in hopes of something else breaking down.  😈  Once I actually get to use it, I will update review."
5,Love it!,2022/1/29,"Unfortunately, I own a 2001 Jeep Cherokee sport that’s seen better days. Frequently have battery issues not because the battery is bad but because the vehicle’s electronics are bad and I have to jump it at least once a month. The unit fits in my personal car safe (handgun safe) and holds a charge for very long periods of time. Lots of little extras like an emergency flasher/flashlight and also a USB charger. Small enough to throw in the glovebox and powerful enough for even the largest vehicles. I love mine and would highly recommend to anyone."
5,Lifesaver for RV Trip,2021/11/15,"My batteries died in my RV, not even enough to start the generator. TWICE! on a two day trip.
I used my Hulkman to jump start the 6V batteries in series to get the generator running and recharged everything. Saved my trip. Despite TWO places (CampingWorld, and Recreation RV Draper), inspecting and certifying my used RV good to go, my system wouldn't run 1 night at 50 degree setting in 30 degree weather on a propane furnace and propane fridge (nothing else turned on). Now to replace my batteries! Strongly recommend for an RV goer.
Tip: Keep it inside with you. It gives an Error 3 warning if it's below 32 degrees F (but still worked)."
5,Will start a 5.0L cummins no problem,2021/12/23,I bought this for my sons car because it was acting up and the parts stores kept telling me the battery was good.  I didn't want anyone to be stranded in his car.  Then my XD Titian started acting like the batteries were dead.  So I hooked it up to the start box and fired right up.  The same thing kept happening and and I used the start box three or four times before I figured out what the problem was (Nissan battery terminals are garbage). It had no issue starting my 5.0L cummins. First start it went from 100% to 93% charge. The second it went from 93% to 85%. Didn't pay attention to the other starts.  Bottom line you should have one of these in each of your daily drivers. I will be buying another for my car and my wife's car.
5,Zap — it works!,2022/1/30,"I’d had to get AAA out to jump a dead battery, so I bought a new battery — and two days later the NEW battery was dead. I was embarrassed to call AAA afain, so I ordered one of these instead. Charged it up in just a few minutes, set it on the dead battery, and ZAP — just like that, it worked! Exactly as advertised.

The instructions have a pretty stupid layout in the handbook, but they are easy to follow. And now I don’t have to worry about whether I leave my lights on or if the alternatir is dying or whatever — this will get me going!"
5,Worth every penny,2022/5/31,"This device is just a pleasure to use. Well made, sturdy and simple to operate. On top of that it works amazingly well. I have used it 3 times in less than a year. I have newish cars with good batteries but a nitwit driving them (me). Left the dome light on, left  something plugged into the aux power and then managed to have something resting on the brake pedal for two days. Each time the car battery was completely dead and the car was started in less than 4 minutes  using the Hulkman. It saved me more than the cost of this product the first time I used it."
3,Didn't work on my Polaris Ranger,2022/3/26,"I really wanted to like this. My ranger was dead at the Ranch and I thought no big deal, I have this new gizmo. It would not auto-detect to charge/boost. I jacked with it several times in the dark trying to get it to just charge my battery so I could get the Ranger to turn over. The next day I dragged an extension cord out and got it going.

I read after the fact that you can do a manual override to force the boost, but at this price point I just wanted it to work.

I'll keep at 3 stars until I can try this in the daylight and see if the override works."
5,"Move over Triple-A, this really works!",2022/3/11,"I bought the Hulkmaster so I can jump my car without having to call my insurance company or flag someone down.  It was already charged at 88% when I first took it out of the box, and charged to 100% after plugging it in for about 10 minutes.  It is super easy to use.  All you have to do is connect the jumper cables to the battery (it will let you know if the cables are reversed) and if the battery is completely dead, you just have to press down both buttons for 2-3 seconds to force jump it.  My battery was completely dead, and it got the car started in less than 30 seconds.  I highly recommend keeping one handy, so you don't have to wait around for Triple-A or a good samaritan to give you a jump."
5,Will buy again.,2021/11/2,"Does exactly what it says it does.  It arrived at 88%, so I charged it up to 100%.  Shortly after receiving it, we had a massive windstorm and our power went out. We had no way of charging our phones but then I remembered I had this and we all took turns charging our phones which really helped because I had to have a wake-up alarm to get up for work.  About two weeks after that, my husband's pickup wouldn't start. I suggested the Hulkman. He tried the regular jump first; didn't work.  I told him to try the force start. That did the trick.  He was impressed...and a little jealous. He wants one for his vehicle, too.  Guess he'll be getting one for Xmas."
4,OK for MOST Vehicles,2022/1/23,"Have now used this about a half dozen times on small SUV, lawn mower, ATV, and 2500 series diesel truck. Seems to be well made. Charges quickly and holds the charge well (so far). Not crazy about the 'time-out' (renders it inoperable for about 10 minutes) it takes if you try three consecutive unsuccessful start attempts.
It did however meet it's match on my 6.6 liter diesel truck......not even a hint of turning it over even though it was fully charged, so note bene the part about it working on ""...up to 8.5 L gas and 6 L diesel engines.."""
5,It Works,2022/3/19,"The battery in my 2003 Tundra totally and completely died after I left the interior light on for a couple days/nights. Went in to start it, and barely a click, no turning over at all. I've had batteries drain completely and become unuseable, so I thought great, have to get a new battery. Thought I would give this unit a try instead. The unit was charged at 81% right out of the box. Plugged it in, and it charged to 100% in 2-3 minutes. Hooked it up to the truck battery, turned the key, and VROOM! Fired right up! I would highly recommend this unit. It's strong, compact, and easy to use. Wish I would have bought it sooner. Also has built in flashlight w/ several modes (bright, dim, flashing, red flashing) and can of course charge your phone, etc. as well."
5,Great product,2022/1/20,Good quality product. Easy to use. Powerful
5,Does what it’s supposed to do,2021/7/21,"I bought so many other products which were duds so I was pretty excited when I got this, Put this on my car, and the thing started. It even started my old car sitting in the back yard. My only issue was the directions I got on the manual. It said connect The cables, ready on screen, and start the engine. What it did it tell you was that you have to push the two buttons simultaneously so that it will say ready. I was getting ready to return it but I watched a video on here you were the guy press both buttons and the screen said ready. When I did that I was able to start my car. In any case is the thing works so he gets an A in my book."
5,THIS IS THE ONE,2021/5/18,"I have this HULKMAN, the NOCO GB40 and GB70. Even though this HULKMAN is priced under the GB40 it is more comparable to the GB70. GB40 is just barely enough to start my car and only if the battery is not completely dead. HULKMAN and GB70 start my car with no problem even if my battery has zero volts.
What i really like about these units is they are the only ones i know of on the market with the protection circuit built into the main unit and not on the cable. My GB70 is still my goto unit but at less than $100 this HULKMAN is absolutely the best jumpbox on the market right know. BUY IT WHILE U STILL CAN"
5,Compact and easy to use.,2022/5/26,"This is an extremely compact unit, with nice features, however I most likely will not be putting high demands on this battery as I am planning it primarily to start my lawn tractor that can’t seem to produce enough oomph to start it. Got tired of continually having to get the big charger out so I decided to spring for one of these. I used a few times and now wonder why I didn’t invest in one sooner.
I am sure it will start my Cherokee and my wife’s 5.7 ltr Hemi in her Ram, but for now it stays close to my garden shed.
Out the box I charged it to 100% and so far it seems to hold charge."
5,Fired up a 5.6 Liter V8,2022/1/27,"have 4 cars and often find a weak battery, Used this on my pickup and it fired up stronger than I have ever seen.  The 5.6 liter v8 does not start if battery is even just a little down, this goes with me whenever I take the truck.  Exceptionally well designed and easy to use and I dont wory abouut frying the electronics.  If you have a car you will need this one day and one start in a parkilng lot at night is worth the purchase price, all the others are free after that.  so well built I expect to last forever.  Think I'll even be able to teach my wfe to use it, would you trust wifey to jump start with a car with jumper cables?  Tells you if reversed connections and turns itself on when propearlyy conneected, idiot proof. but mostly...Powerful beyond belief."
5,Easy and effective,2021/4/8,This was so easy to use and my car started immediately. I travel and live in the city so I can go a month or two without starting my car. This was so easy even I couldn’t mess it up. There’s no plug in our parking garage so I needed something that I could charge upstairs and then take down to my car. This came with a 76% charge when I initially plugged it in. I charged it to 100% and then went to try it on my car. As soon as I hooked up the cables it read “ready” and my car started right away. Super simple and effective.
5,I love this jump starter works as described very easy to use at a great price,2021/7/23,This jump starter works great charges fast as a great product for the money
1,Cane in defective couldn’t jump start not even once,2021/8/22,So I contacted the seller for resolution before the 30 day window gave them one week still no response..Came  in defective  not charging not boosting
5,Worked like a champ every time I used it!,2022/4/15,"My neighbor came over and asked me if I could jump her truck that had sat in her garage for 8 months.  She expected us to have to push it out onto the street, then get my truck and jumper cables to finish the job.  Nope!  I pulled this bad boy out and hooked it up right there in the garage.  The battery was totally dead, which worried me because the directions that came with the device said something about completely dead batteries might not be able to be jumped.  Well, I said, ""here goes""...bam!  Fired the old girl right up and only used 2% of the charge!  I can't believe that kind of punch comes out of such a small package--but it does!"
5,Hulk man jump starter,2022/5/31,So convenient to keep in vehicle in case of dead battery.
5,Reliable Constantly Using Roadside Assistance!,2021/9/9,"I have been using the Hulkman for the last 5 months with amazing reliability. In a regular day I am using this to jumpstart 10 or more vehicles! As a roadside assistance guy this is my favorite tool, I feel like it will jumpstart anything.

This thing never fails! If someone wrote a review saying this thing doesn't work they probably have other underlying issues with their car or simply oblivious that other things happen from starters to starter relay fuses to operator error not making a good ground connection.

Charging, I keep a simple inverter plugged in my car so I can use the Hulkman wall adapter while driving and always keep it charged. It charges faster than my cell phone!

Durability! I drop this thing in the street all of the time! It still works perfectly! It has alot of integrity.

Charging Cable/Customer Service!
My constant use of plugging and unplugging this ruined this speed charger. I reached out to the warranty team and was immediately shipped a new one.

Multi use!
This does not need to be used just for jumping your ragged car and its 5 year old battery! I take my kids to six flags and this keeps all of phones charged thru the day.

Big plus I constantly stop and help people on the side of highways at night with tire changes, while doing this I have the Hulkmans strobe light for a little safety. I just lay the Hulkman strobe light on the roof or the trunk of the car, with its heavy weight I do not need to worry about the wind of a 80mph car making it fall off of my car or anything else.

If I could sell this product out of the trunk of my car I would!"
5,quality,2021/11/21,The portability is lacking because it doesn't come with a travel case and that's why I gave it 2 stars in that category. Packaging is very high quality. Seems like a high quality product. TIME WILL TELL .
5,Holy Moly Donut Shop!,2021/10/11,What just happened? It jumped started this dead battery is what just happened! First try baby! Makes you step back and take a deep breath and enjoy knowing this will be with you at all times. I told my wife if it cranks up the dead battery the first time I will leap into the air and land into the splits position and I did! Now if I can only get out!
5,Does what it says it can do!!!,2021/9/27,"Easy to use, and it really works, I recommend this to anyone, a child can work this !!!"
5,Great,2022/5/26,Great
5,Great jump starter,2022/2/12,"My car battery was dead for a week, and I had to use this jump starter every time to start my car before I get a new battery. This jump starter works every time, and no failure. Definitely recommended."
5,Read it back if starts blinking to get it unlocked safety device,2021/12/12,"I love this item so much I purchased two I keep one in my vehicle and one at our mechanic shop. I have a 700$ Snapon jump box that is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen not only that it is the heaviest piece of crap you have to carry around for it not to work. I decided to give this one a try and I love it it has to be the best one I have ever used it does a lot. It charges super fast and it will start a battery at 10% I think that’s amazing. I first had my doubts but it has proven me wrong. For what I paid for my snap on junk box I could have bought six of these, and saved my back and the time of walking back-and-forth because the Snap On piece of crap would not do nothing. I love this fine piece of equipment…."
5,Charges my car 🔋super fast,2021/12/18,"I have used this jump starter on my car v6 and my truck v8 a couple of times and it has done a great job jump starting them in only a couple of min. It's also very efficient and comes in handy. Totally recommend, and battery seems to last even when stored away. It also charges super fast so it isn't a hassle."
,,,"Ho acquistato questo prodotto due mesi e mezzo fa , dopo aver caricato le sue batterie è rimasto ""in attesa"" del primo utilizzo. Ieri , batteria di una Matiz scaricata totalmente a zero  , lo connetto e  lui accende la macchina immediatamente : la sua batteria interna passa dall 99% al 94% .  Che dire , da tecnico , impossibile progettare un oggetto con design/materiali/ autonomia/facilità di uso migliore di questo."
,,,"Prodotto, di alto livello e costa molto meno rispetto al suo rivale noco. l'ho acquistato a dicembre del 2021,ho aspettato tutti questi mesi perché volevo testare le caratteristiche, e per verificare se le informazioni riportate nella pagina fossero esatte. Prima di questo articolo ne ho provati altri due modelli di altre marche in poco tempo li ho bruciati, questo invece è perfetto. Mentre altri esemplari hanno bisogno di essere ricaricati almeno una volta al mese, non succede con alpha85, da quando l'ho acquistato non è stato ancora caricato, usato due volte lo starter, si attesta sul 70%. E' rimasto in macchina tutto l'inverno. Pinze di ottima qualità, come anche il caricabatterie, carica veloce ,rispetto all'utilizzo del solo  cavetto. Non ci sono accessori anonimi sono tutti marchiati, sinonimo di qualità ed attenzione. Cose da migliorare, avendo un display così ampio non capisco perché non sia stato aggiunto un amperometro per verificare lo stato della batteria.  Manca la custodia comprata a parte."
,,1905/7/13,"Dati tecnici ottimi, acquistato in sostituzione di un precedente avviatore di altra marca acquistato 6 anni fa ma con caratteristiche tecniche inferiori.
Non ancora potuto provarlo, ma da mia esperienza questi oggetti anche se costano nell'emergenza ripagano."
5,Light - easy - works - everyone should have one,2021/10/11,Works as advertised
,,1905/7/14,"Possiedo questo oggetto da pochi giorni. Già dal primo contatto si può apprezzare la solidità del prodotto, gli assemblaggi perfetti e la qualità dei materiali impiegati sia per il corpo che per i vari cavi. L'ho ricevuto con il 78% di carica e l'ho portato a 0% caricandoci 3 volte un iPhone 8, una volta l'iPad mini e uno smartwatch. Ancora non ho avuto modo di avviare la macchina ma dubito possano sorgere problemi. Confezione molto curata nei dettagli. Amazon come sempre una garanzia. Unica pecca è l'assenza di una custodia da utilizzare per riporlo nel bagagliaio della propria auto in maniera ordinata. Dato il costo non proprio basso, poteva essere data in dotazione."
,,1900/1/2,Perfetto e di qualità Anna ho visti altri ma non mi spiravano effettivamente questo vale i soldi che spendi.al momento non l’ho ancora utilizzato per accendere la batteria ma per il resto tutto perfetto lo uso principalmente per andare in giro come Power bank
5,Buy it before you need it !,2020/12/4,"It’s a product you hope you never need, but hope you have it if you do need it. First off the build quality is great. The unit feels solid and appears to be made of good materials. The LCD screen is easy to read and has icons that will illuminate to let you know what’s going on.

This thing charges fast ! Mine came 66% charged and was at 100% in 20 minutes. Knowing that even if it is completely dead you can get enough charge to jumpstart your car in 5 minutes is a great piece of mind.

I brought it to work where we have a Jetta that hasn’t been run in months so I knew it would be dead. Turned the key first and absolutely nothing happened. Connected Hulkman jumpstarter and it did not detect the battery because bit was so low. I held the power and light buttons for a couple seconds and the unit turned on and immediately said ready. I tried the key again and it started right up.

I couldn’t be happier with the price point and power of this unit. It has more power and features than product priced much higher than this. I have seen people use the Halo jump starter at work and it would not start a car if the battery was completely dead, not this unit. Highly recommended.

I almost forgot, this can double as a charger for your phone as well. Leave a phone cable with it in your car and never be without your phone in an emergency also.

**** Update*****

Used it again at work today for someone who’s battery didn’t hold up to the cold weather. The Hulkman charger was left in my car for about a week at full charge and it was still full before I jumped the car. After it was jumped it only went down to 98% as shown in the picture."
,,1905/7/14,È evidente un prodotto con pochi “fronzoli” e molta sostanza e semplicità. Anche se assemblato in Cina si vede la progettazione U.S.A e l’assemblaggio secondo canoni U.S.A. Unico difetto non si riesce a trovare la custodia originale.
,,1905/7/14,"Semplicemente straordinario, inizialmente ero un po scettico, nonostante tutti i video visti su YouTube, ma mi sono dovuto ricredere in una maniera incredibile, quando è arrivato a casa, lho portato dal mio meccanico per fare qualche prova, il quale incuriosito da quello ché poteva riuscire a fare questo avviatore, ha letteralmente staccato entrambi i cavi dalle batterie di varie auto, iniziato con una 1,7 poi una 1,9 poi una 2,0 tutte diesel, è tutte le volte ha fatto partire le auto al primo colpo per più di una volta, tanto è vero ché il mio meccanico me lha fatto ordinare subito la sera stessa uno anche per lui, perché ha detto ché era troppo buono, quindi vi posso garantire e assicurare ché questo booster della hulkman fa veramente tutto quello ché dice nella descrizione, lo consiglio a tutti."
,,1905/7/14,"Ho ordinato questo prodotto in offerta a 109,64 euri il giorno 6 febbraio 2022.
Purtroppo è arrivato difettoso, Non carica nessun SmarthPhone, la Torcia non si accende ed il display lampeggia in continuazione con tutte le spie illuminate.
L'Impressione è che la qualità costruttiva è molto buona, ma purtroppo nel caso volessi acquistare nuovamente il prodotto il prezzo notevolmente aumento.
Tra i fattori negativi da segnalare è che non è fornito di serie di una custodia."
,,1905/7/14,"È un attrezzo indispensabile che può tornare utile su tanti fronti: dalla vettura che non parte alla moto non utilizzata per lungo tempo con la batteria scarica.
Inoltre è utilissimo per quando si necessita di una fonte di energia a portata di mano per ricaricare i cellulari della famiglia in modo rapido.
È fatto molto bene e la qualità dei materiali si percepisce a colpo d'occhio.
Il packaging è completo ed è corredato di tutto ciò che serve per renderlo versatile.
Unica pecca, con quello che lo paghi dovrebbe essere incluso un bag, invece l'unico previsto è a parte e costa 34 euro."
,,1905/7/13,Mi è piaciuto molto il funzionamento molto facile e intuitivo ha gli accessori che servono non mi è piaciuto il fatto che non ha una custodia rigida dove poterlo proteggere la sola scatola di cartone mi sembra poco alla lunga si distrugge comunque ottimo prodotto lo ricomprerei un’altra volta
,,,"Ho acquistato questo articolo principalmente come Power Bank di emergenza nel caso la batteria della mia auto o moto dovesse scaricarsi o guastarsi.
Durante i miei viaggi in moto non può mancare è una garanzia!
Può fungere anche da ricarica per il cellulare essendo dotato di porte USB e C
Molto bello e utile anche il display che indica la carica e lo stato del power bank quando lo colleghi alla batteria.
Protetto praticamente in tutto, corto circuito, inversione di polarità, sovraccarico, etc...
Le due note negative, almeno per me sono :
1) Il prezzo, troppo caro!!
2) Il peso
Si giustificano in parte per la capacità veramente elevata e il brand.

Se non avete un'auto con motore oltre i 2000cc non lo sfrutterete al massimo. Per il resto consigliato"
,,1905/7/13,"Ottimo prodotto qualità di alto livello robusto, ma la cosa importante è che da quello che dice potenza è avviamento sicuro, provato staccando persino la batteria  e la macchina è partita al primo colpo lo consiglio a tutti molto utile."
,,1905/7/14,"Dopo aver provato alcuni avviatori di amici, ho deciso di acquistarne uno. Dopo una breve ricerca ho deciso di acquistare questo Hulkman Alpha 85 per le ottime recensioni su Amazon e per le recensioni viste su Youtube. Appena arrivato ho avuto l'occasione di testarlo per far partire uno scooter fermo da mesi. Prima ho fatto una prova con l'avviatore di un mio amico (con una batteria sicuramente inferiore) senza però riuscire ad avviare lo scooter. Collegato all'Hulkman la differenza è stata immediata, lo spunto che ha fornito l'avviatore è stato notevolmente superiore e con pochi secondi lo scooter si è acceso. Grande qualità dei materiali e facilità di utilizzo. Unica piccola pecca la mancanza di una custodia per il trasporto o meglio, l'azienda produce la custodia ma non l'ho trovata su Amazon."
,,1900/1/22,"La qualità di questo prodotto si percepisce già dal suo confezionamento, aperta la splendida scatola si trova il booster compatto ,con grande schermo ed accessori tutti di fabbricazione Hulkman compreso l'ottimo caricatore rapido dedicato.Consigliatissimo."
,,1900/1/2,"Purtroppo l'ho comprato dopo che mi si è fermata la macchina e sono stato salvato da un vicino di casa con un avviatore old style. Ho scoperto che le auto ibride hanno una batteria da 12v molto piccola e poco prestazionali, dato che non avendo alternatore e/o motorino di avviamento non è necessaria una batteria ausiliaria prestante.. peccato che basta usare la radio per più di un tot e la macchina non parte più. Ho voluto comprare qualcosa che fosse durevole considerando che spero di non averne mai bisogno. Questo Hulkman si presenta assolutamente come un avviatore premium, dal packaging, all'oggetto in se, molto robusto e quel bello schermo lcd gigante. I cavi sono belli e robusti, si vede che c'è tanto rame...unico GRANDE difetto è la lunghezza dei suddetti cavi. Sulla mia ibrida la batteria è chiusa nel bagagliaio, nel cofano c'è il contatto + nella scatola fusibili e la massa a 90cm di distanza (indicato dal manuale)...capisco che il rame costa e che il 90% delle auto oggi sono ancora ""normali"" con batteria a vista, ma a questa cifra avrei preferito dei cavi più lunghi o almeno la possibilità di prolunga, non prevista nemmeno come optional."
1,"After owning for 1 year, won't charge past 69%.",2022/5/21,"Had for a year now and worked great, saved me from a few jams, but now it will not charge past 69%. Wont eve show that its charging when plugged in

Been like this for two months and I gave such a poor rating because something this costly should last me longer than a year. Boo."
,,1900/1/22,"Il prodotto si presenta bene anche con una bella scatola, a occhio si vede che e fatto per resistere nel tempo  e anche abbastanza pesante completo di cavi per accensione e un ottimo alimentatore per la ricarica. Non ho dato 5 stelle perché per il prezzo che vale altri concorrenti meno costosi lo danno nel pacchetto complessivo qui lo devi acquistare a parte."
5,First use: It worked on 2019 Outback with dead battery.,2021/12/27,"First use: It worked on 2019 Outback with dead battery.
Map light left on overnight drained car battery (shame on Japan for no warning gong).
Had to read directions carefully to see dead battery protocol of pushing two buttons at once.
In maybe 30 seconds got a ready to start message, engine cranked and started OK.
Procedure drained jump starter from 100% to 85%.
Recharged OK, No problem."
,,1905/7/14,"Semplicemente fantastico, una volta deciso di acquistare un booster visto che a dicembre sono rimasto a piedi di punto in bianco con la macchina con la batteria che fino all'ultima accensione non mi aveva avvertito di nessun cedimento e visto che ho un trattore (fiat 505) fermo da 8 anni con batteria praticamente inesistente, ho deciso di comprare questo booster visto le recensioni e video che fa partire il veicolo anche senza batteria, devo dire che sono rimasto più che soddisfatto, l'ho attaccato alla batteria del mio trattore come ho detto fermo da 8 anni ed è partito al primo colpo!  Spettacolare."
5,Perfect - Powerful - Easy to use,2022/3/21,"This does what it says, does it well, and does it easily. My mom’s car sits idle a lot and regularly needs a jump due to the batteries long breaks from getting charged (as she is 85 and doesn’t prefer to drive much). This is the perfect solution to give her an easy and safe jumpstart. The safety features are great and easy to use. While I normally sill use this to help her when her battery dies, it is actually simple enough to use, I was able to show her how to use it if I wasn’t available. Very nice product."
,,1905/7/14,"Dopo essere rimasto in panne con l'auto per la batteria scarica ho deciso di dotarmi di questo apparecchio.
In passato avevo un vecchio booster per avviamento di cui sono sempre rimasto deluso, riusciva a mettere in moto a malapena uno scooter, per cui ero restio ad un nuovo acquisto. Ho voluto fidarmi delle recensioni positive ed ho fatto bene, per cui decido di lasciare anche la mia visto che per me sono state utili. Per testarlo ho provato a mettere in moto un Komatsu pc 35 fermo da alcuni anni la cui batteria risale al 2008, completamente scarica. Ho dovuto forzare il booster con i due pulsanti, dopodiché girando la chiave ha fatto una scintilla enorme e pensavo di aver bruciato il booster. Ho riprovato e dopo due o tre tentativi il motore è partito. Dopo la prima accensione ho provato altre 4/5 volte ed è sempre partito al primo colpo, la batteria alla fine era ancora al 75%. Se dura nel tempo è ottimo."
5,Tremendous,2022/5/17,"I finally got sick to death of calling AAA and waiting an hour for them to jump start a dead car battery. Nothing against AAA - I'm a loyal member for many years - but it just became an annoyance; and this is something I should be able to do on my own. I tried many times to jump start car to car with jumper cables, but that never seemed to work. This battery charger worked INSTANTLY. Nothing confusing about it. Out of the box, charged, and the car came back to life on the first attempt."
1,It didn’t work,2021/9/20,"Car battery was dead, put it in quick start mode said it was ready I started the car and nothing … had to call a friend to give me a jump. Really disappointed!!!"
5,Exactly what I need,2022/5/31,"Does what it says and works perfectly! I have a sports car I park all winter and can't use trickle charger because my old garage has no electric. So dead battery every spring. This jumps the car easy and fast and no need to bother with hooking up to another car. Great to have on hand for jumps and charging phones and lap tops during those summer storm power losses too. Been wanting this for a while, should have bought sooner. Get the case others talk about too. Perfect fit at great price."
5,This thing is absolutely awesome,2021/8/14,"I must say I was skeptical about this before I bought it, I was used to using the old school large jump starters. I have a large V8 truck and the battery was dead a couple of times in that truck, And when I mean it was dead, nothing cut on. This thing was able to get it jump started immediately with no struggle. Not only that, it works great for charging everything else you might need to charge. I use it all the time for my phone or laptop. I'm writing this review in hopes  it helps somebody out who might be on the fence about buying this.  Because I'm one of those people that read the reviews."
5,Great jump box for the price,2021/12/16,"This jump box has more than what you need for getting the job done. From jump starting vehicles to charging your phone, this thing can do it. I worked with fleet vehicles, and was able to jump start cars that were deadline from the fleet to move them, when everyone else had issues. I believe  I jumped over 20 vehicles on a single charge. The toughest challenge it had was a new Ram 1500 6.2 Hemi with a completely blown battery, at least one bad cell. Took a couple tries, but that truck started. Owner of the truck took pics of this jump box to buy one himself."
5,WOW!! Hulkman 85s,2021/4/27,"WOW!! I have had several jumpstarters, from the lead acid to lithium ion to just a tractor battery with a set of cables. I have a lot of farm equipment and construction equipment and one thing is guaranteed, either the battery is dead or it has a flat tire when you need to use it. I just received the booster ( hulkman 85s ) and it had 79% charge on it out of the box. I commenced to start things that had dead batteries and WOW!! The first thing I jumped was my Polaris ranger and I have jumped it off more times than not and I have never,never heard it start that fast before period. It will not start unless there is a battery on what ever it is that you are trying to start,which I know there are people that are thinking why would you but for a small engine that is a very handy feature to have. So far so good. I will update as the hay season progresses and this winter. I am excited to see how it handles Diesel engines this coming winter. As for now I will be ordering at least 2 more for my wife’s vehicle and my work truck.

10/1/21
Update: You can start a car with a dead battery and I have started a small tractor with NO battery. I have purchased 2 more of these for a total of 3. These things are great. I recommend them highly. I would recommend purchasing the case for it, it keeps every thing together and easy to use. I wish they would sell the case with the charger. Another great feature is the fast charge. The lowest I have pulled mine down to is 51% and it charged it back up in less than 15 minutes.
Awesome gadget to have."
5,This works Great!,2022/2/18,"I don't drive much these days with the shutdowns, so I now keep my car on a trickle charger, but neglected to plug it in last week. Today I needed to run an errand and the battery was dead, couldn't even unlock it. (I now know how to do that with dead battery). It was too low for my little trickle charger to do anything. It just shut off because of low voltage. So I got on Amazon, found this jump starter. It was delivered a few hours later. Read how to set it for force start, hooked it up, got the error the battery was too low, I did the force start mode and woohoo, the car came back to life and started started right up. I love it when things just work."
5,Better than the Matco Jumper,2022/3/18,I bought it after using the Matco one for years just because of the price and reviews. Matco is triple the price. It blows the matco jump box out of the water. Charges extremely fast for a jump box and is good for multiple jumps even on a 12v battery under 6vs. Extremely impressed with thus jump box and highly recommend it. Even if it only lasts 2 or 3 years it's worth it. My matco jump box lasted about 3 years and then the battery expanded out of the casing.
5,Amazing,2021/7/14,"I love love love this
jump starter,. I ordered it yesterday came in today It had an 84% charge it took 5 minutes to charge it to 100% and I followed the instruction, (please read the manual) if you have a dead battery as I did you have to press the two buttons so that being said, it started immediately, I didn't even know this product existed but when I had no one that could give me a charge I came upon this wonderful gadget. It comes in a very elegant box not a case but you can keep it in the box that it comes in and it is well protected. It is so well made, manageable, easy to use and it looks like it would last for years to come. I just placed it in the trunk of the car, I drove my car to do a few errands and not an issue with the battery started every time. I will never again be worried about having a dead battery. Don't think about it if you are looking for a jump starter this is the one, I did plenty of research before deciding on this one and I am so very happy with my decision. I would give it 6 stars!"
5,Should have found this earlier,2021/9/23,"When my cars battery died a tow truck guy came out and used this on my car. It was jumped instantly. I was charged $50. I went home and bought this and it is so easy to use! All you have to do is connect the clamps and push one button and start your car! The battery can also be used to charge things. My IPad charged within minutes! It also. Has. A lighter connector for the car. I ended up having to buy a new battery, so I gave it to my daughter to use since I probably won’t need it for a while. I can see myself buying another one."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,2022/3/13,Great product does what it's for. Used it twice on 2 different vehicles works like a charm. Still haven't had to recharge. Brought this because I drive in the city for work all day (rideshare) and enjoy helping other when in need. I store the cable in my trunk and keep the battery in a bag I take home everyday. I've heard these batteries get damaged if left in the vehicle for to long due to the weather so I'm playing it safe. I was going for the Noco brand but they're way overpriced.
1,Product failed - had an error - never worked the 3 times i attempted to use,2021/10/30,Each time i used this recently it failed. Shows as a 100% but once it is connected to the car the error code flashes and the product will not turn the charge on.  I recommend some other product.
5,Awesome Product,2021/5/25,"If you need a jump starter, you need to get this. I bought this and an 12 volt air pump. I have absolutely no complaints. I have jumped a bunch of vehicles from my 99 Silverado that had a stone cold dead battery. The truck cranked over like it has been running everyday with this jumper. I also used it with my new air pump. The pump pulls 25 amps and is too much to plug into most cigarette lighter sockets that are 20 amp. I used the jumper and was able to fill 2 tires on my wife's 03 Lexus Rx300 before the power level was too low.(60%) Oh and charging time is very fast. It charged from 55% to full in about 25 to 30 minutes with the wall plug. You can charge it like a phone but it will take much longer. All in all, I'd buy it again. Actually a good item to have on hand in case the power goes out to charge devices."
2,Didn’t do anything,2021/12/4,Bought it to jump my motorcycle and apart from the jumper cables being a bit short it just didn’t do anything. Said it was 100% charged and (instructions were practically nonexistent) when i hooked it up and waited to see a “ready” it just never happened. Eventually it would time out and shut off. Flashlight feature works tho.
5,Was hesitant…now - SUPER IMPRESSED!!,2022/3/21,"Shopped around for a while to try and find a jump starter that would be strong enough to jump start my 2011 Tahoe - V8 engine..I was having a hard time believing that such a small device could handle jump starting a battery for a V8 / SUV. Previously I worked in the car business for many years and we had to use very heavy jump starter packs some that were too heavy to even carry that had wheels..and sometimes they didn’t even work..so I was very hesitant to get this. But when my battery was dead in the Tahoe I thought might as well give it a shot. Arrived next morning and I hooked it up and literally started without any hesitation whatsoever. I was absolutely shocked. Could have saved me a couple car deals and time back in car sales!!! Anyway super glad I found this. Versatile, lightweight, charges up fast plugged into the wall and into the 12V accessory socket/“cigarette lighter” and the devices batter is barely affected by a jump start. A must have in every vehicle, and would be a great gift for new drivers too!"
5,A no nonsense well made tool.,2021/9/10,"On opening the box I was impressed at the solid feel and weight of the jump starter. It came 80% charged out of the box and took less than half an hour to fully charge. the light is bright enough to see what you are doing after dark. Though I have not had to try to start my car yet the directions are EASY to understand and remember for anyone. I think it is an inexpensive insurance policy to keep the ones you love from being stranded out away from home. I remember being a distracted kid a couple of times, leaving the dome light on and finding a dead battery when it was time to leave. I wish these things were around back then."
5,This really works on my 2019 Subaru Ascent,2021/12/2,"I have a 2019 Subaru Ascent and have had issues with the battery.  I was told by the Subaru dealership that if you leave your tailgate open too long or if you don't drive very much there is a possibility that your battery power will decrease enough that your car won't start. Well a few weeks ago this happened again.  I can jump start the car off of another car and I am back in business, but what happens if there is no other car!!! I bought this car jump starter and it works. 5 super stars for it.  0 stars for Subaru."
5,Great Buy and started my car first try,2021/8/7,"I purchased this because my car battery died and I need to jump it to get it to the dealer. The engine is a 5.2L, car is only putting out 3.2 Volts and not 12.4 for a normal car. after this unit started the car it has 94% left. Battery clamps have a good bit and open to easily clam on the battery post. I tried another unit before I purchased this unit and it would not even try and turn the engine. First impressions on the Hulkman is it will do the job. Nice that they have cases, but be nice if it came with even just a bag to hold the cables and charger.  If you have cars you can't go wrong."
5,Amazing product A+++,2022/5/29,"This thing is a baby monster. Baby in the sense that it's small in size but a monster it what it can do. I am a car hauler, and I've used this several times to turn on a dead battery. What really impresses me is the fact that I can turn on a car that's been sitting for months with NO battery attached!  I can also connect my 12v air compressor to it to pump air in my trailer tires, no problem. Great investment in tools. Forget about jumper cables, I will be buying thus again for my personal car."
5,Charged!,2021/6/24,"I have a Ford F-150 that I drive maybe twice a week. It sat for a week and a half and a brand new battery was drained. I hooked the charger up and it turned over on the first try only using 3% charging power! So far I’m happy.

UPDATE!
I've used this charger several times, even rescued others with weak or dead battery. So far it is working very well. I just bailed my son out with weak battery, going to buy him one as a gift. I still stand at 5 Stars! The speed charger for the charger is super quick!"
1,What a joke,2022/2/20,Not happy with this purchase.  Thought that this would at least come with a pouch or something to keep all this together in but nope.  You have to pay $35 separately for something to hold it all together. So I'm just supposed to have this all over my trunk? Even my $20 battery packs come with a case. How pathetic!
5,No case. No problem. (Almost),2021/5/31,"I don't normally write reviews, but wanted to this time since I've found an inexpensive solution to the no case problem. A Hyper Tough Stackable Utility Storage Box. It's only $5 from Walmart (found in the tool section with the toolboxes at my Walmart). As you can see from the picture, everything fits perfectly inside. Almost like it was made for it.

As for the jump starter, I haven't had an opportunity to use it yet, but it appears to be made very well. And packaged well too. Also has a better warranty than any other jump starter I've checked out. It has a 24 month warranty with 12 additional months (36 months total) if you join the Hulkman club (email list) according to the card that comes in the box. Just wanted to mention that if there are ever any warranty issues, you will need your Amazon order number and possibly the serial number. I couldn't find a serial number on my jump starter but it is on the bottom or back of the outer part of the box.

I'm still giving it 5 stars (even though it didn't come with a case) because of how well it's made and the long warranty."
5,Sturdy and Compact,2021/8/2,"The jump starter arrived right on time. I opened the box, read the manual, and plugged it in to charge. (It arrived with a 77% charge.) All the buttons I tested did exactly what was expected.

Sadly (or happily, depending on your point of view) I haven't needed to test its ability to start my car when the battery is dead.

The starter appears really well built. It is compact and fits into the shallow space where the jack lives in my Santa Fe. If and when I need to use it, I'll update this review."
5,"Works great, Need to read manual for those with bad reviews!",2022/3/3,"Those that Can't get it to work when says ready, I have found its from a fault with the battery or newer car systems trigger it as a problem, So Just PUSH both bottoms for about 3 to 5 seconds until it by passes the reg ready start it will then Work fine with full power even working with NO battery in the car if needed, I used it to Roll up All windows in a 2000 Expedition that had the battery stolen, Worked like a charm!"
4,UNUSED so how would i know?,2021/11/11,"This seems to be a well made unit but using it will degrade it.  So, I have not tested it beyond charging and checking everything I could without actually starting my truck with it.The packaging is clearly expensive.  It would make a very nice gift but the packaging is really a waste.  I would have preferred to pay less for it.Overall I think i got what I wanted...something to save my butt when my garbage OEM Toyota battery fails...and it will soon as it is out of warranty and many others have had it fail shortly thereafter.  Not a coincidence.  I could have bought another battery but would eventually be in the same position years from now.  Peace of mind."
5,Better than magic,2022/1/13,"I could not believe how easy this thing is to use. We had some cheap jumper cables that we could not get to Jump start my wife’s suv after several attempts. This hulkman jump starter is incredible. Hooked it up to the dead battery terminals, literally about 4 seconds and the “ready” indicator turned on. We pressed the car start button and started normally as if we had a full battery. Definitely will be keeping one in each of our cars"
4,NEVER AGAIN will I have a dead battery.,2022/4/10,"Took a road trip in a newer / used car. I think I left my headlights on (thought they were on automatic). Next morning car was stone cold DEAD......and me - from Wisconsin was without cables. Strike #2. Was blessed with kindness from a stranger - he had cables and off we went. Hotel had a small portable unit but it had discharged. The above explained the need for this product. I bought the Hulkman. Months later it still shows a 100% charge. I bought a second for my wife's car.

Things happen, and now I'm better prepared. I hope some day to discover a stranded motorist so I can repay the kindness I received.

P.S. - the ONLY reason I gave this item 4 stars was that it does NOT come with a carrying case- that is extra. I wish they'd just bump the price and include the case. FYI - it comes in a quality box - that would be sufficient to protect the item in your trunk."
5,Worked Right Out of the Box..,2021/10/3,"Working on my van, I left the key in ACC all day and night. Next day, no start.  Could have jumped it with another vehicle but i wanted a jumper box for security when i'm on the road camping. So a little research and ordered on Amazon at 8pm and it was on my doorstep at 7am in the morning.70% charged right out of the box, but charged it to 100%. An hour later, 2 minutes to hook up and 10 seconds my van started on the first try!!.  I am a FAN.  Can charge up fast, last up to 18 month of storage, and can charge my electronics. Perfect for my new build CamperVan minivan no matter where i am. Not worried about leaving the lights on anymore."
5,Love the special feature for really big vehicles,2022/4/12,"This thing is amazing I’ve used it about eight times already on three different vehicles and just today jumped a huge 8 seat custom van.
It wasn’t working at first so I did the trick where you hold both buttons down and that works every time!!

If the battery is really really dead on a big vehicle you may have to leave it on a minute crank the car, hit the 2 buttons again crank the car , repeat three or four times but it will start. Amazing !! And so tiny!!"
5,Works the first time everytime!,2022/3/14,"Extremely handy to have, I have an older car I don't drive often, and the battery dies frequently in the winter. It was a pain to get my truck in there to jump start it, but this is super easy to use and works great. It's small enough to tuck it away, everything you need fits in the box/case. It tells you what the % charge is so you know if you need to charge it back up. I can't recommend it highly enough. It started my 6.2L that was completely dead immediately."
5,Iphone for Jump Starter,2021/4/28,"Top-quality product and it is like an i-phone for Jump Starter.  The unit feels solid, powerful, and made of good material. The LCD screen is big and easy to read.  Super easy instruction on the back of the product. You don’t need to carry the instruction manual. Superfast charger, charge 0 to 100% under 1.5 hours.  100 times better than any product in the market and far better than NOCO 50 with ½ the price. This product looks expensive and works like a pro, super powerful with 2000 Peak AMPS. It can jump-start any passenger GAS vehicle & Diesel up to 6 L Diesel. Hulkman jump-started my Diesel RAM 1500 super heavy truck without any hesitationI couldn’t be happier with the price point and power of this unit. It has more power and features than products priced much higher than this. This product is a power bank, Flashlight, and Jumpstarter all in one but doesn't look like Jump Starter."
5,Worth every penny,2022/2/16,"I had to use this on my car a few times already and it worked perfectly every time.  I bought this because I was tired of getting out the jumper cables and connecting my car to another car.  This Hulkman jump starts makes the process extremely simple.  The battery on the jump starter drains quickly depending on the condition of the car battery.  However, the jump starter battery changes quickly with the included charger.Overall, I’m am very happy I decided to get this product."
5,Used it several times on Hybrid car,2021/11/26,"I've had issues with the battery in my Hybrid Toyota Prius . It isn't the hybrid battery which propels the car that is issue but the separate starter battery that runs the computer and starts the engine. Have used the Alpha85 to jump start it twice now and it is still at 99%.

I know myself and others have concerns jumping the starter battery in a hybrid because they are not standard car batteries but the Alpha85 works effectively and safely."
5,"Excellent product; well designed, easy to use",2022/2/26,"Excellent product!  Works as advertised: started a 1997 Nissan Quest (3L V6) with a completely dead battery w/o issue a couple of times.  Seems well designed, well built and easy to use.  Really like the nice, big, clear display.  Charging of its battery with the included 65W charger is very fast also."
5,Saved me a major headache the day after it arrived!,2021/4/26,"I had the battery for a day before I needed to use it. Given we're working from home, the cars don't get used much and my wife's car battery simply needs to be replaced. We went to take my car in for an oil change and her car battery was dead. I hooked up the jumper and her car started right away. We had the jumper charged to 100% and after using is it, it read 99%. The included benefit of the built in light was really useful.

I'll be buying another to keep in my car as well at this point. This thing is foolproof!"
5,Works Very Well!,2022/4/21,"I own a transmission repair shop and find myself having to jump start a customers vehicle at least once a week.  I bought this to replace a bulky jump box that was no longer functioning.  I was worried this product would have to be sent back after reading a review left by a car lot that claimed it wouldn't start anything.  My reveiw is while this unit is much smaller that my old jump box, i'ts much stronger.  It jump starts V-8 engines, no problem.  I highly recommend this product."
5,It Works,2021/6/29,"Received it on a Tue ended up needing it on Fri morning.  Came out Fri morning to go to work to a vehicle that wouldn't start, just clicked.  I hooked up the Hulkman and got the ""Ready"" indication, turned the key and my Jeep started right up.  Hulkman was at 100% then after jumping the Jeep (3.8L) it only dropped to 95%.The only negative I have so far is that it doesn't come with a bag.  If they'd cut back on the expensive fancy packaging it comes in (which just goes in the trash anyway) they could at least include a cheap nylon bag/pouch to keep it all together,"
4,Gets the job done,2021/12/24,"I've used it about 6 times from jumping a v8 engine to jumping a completely dead battery and always worked. My complaint is the cigarette adapter, after using it twice for a memory saver in obd2 port it won't work no more, the obd2 device lights up red indicating its working but the jumper isn't saying it's supplying power, tried a friend's adapter and it worked but only lasted for 20sec till it said no power being supplied to the cords.
2). After using the fast charger, let it sit out a bit cuz the wall plug in does get how and I was afraid to put it back in my tool box over night if a fire started.

All in all I like that it jump starts every 6 times I've used it, I'll update it it crashes xD"
4,#NAME?,2022/1/8,"A few years ago I bought at Walmart a similar thing, but When I had to use it it didn't start my car... Then after a year it didn't hold a charge anymore.... To be fair, maybe it was defective. I decided to try this and found it saved me now twice... 2013 Ford Focus and an 2007 Saturn Ion... Both had original batteries and died when the winter cold hit. Just clicks when trying to start... Both started like new when I connected this...  So far a fan... We'll see................"
5,Work like magic,2022/2/11,"I bought this Jump Starter for my son.  I left it inside his older car.  Then one day I needed to drive his car to the mechanic.  Unfortunately, the battery was completely dead.  So I was super disappointed.  Then I realized that the Jump Starter was there.  I opened it.  Lucky for me, it was at 82%.  I connected it to the battery and started the car without any problem at all.  It dropped to 79%.  I definitely recommend this product.  It was so easy to use."
4,Good product at a good price,2021/11/15,I needed a battery booster to keep around for my growing collection of older cars and this came up as a deal of the day. I have found it to be most efficient as starting everything from 4 to 8 cylinder motors. It does have a safety feature that kicks in to protect the internal battery after 5 start attempts. It can be annoying at times but I understand it is there for the health and protection of the internal battery. I have not had it fail me yet. A worthwhile buy in my opinion.
5,Works better than the other competition,2021/12/26,"I work on cars all day and in the cold season, every car that comes in has a dead battery issue. This thing starts right away not like the Noco brand I have that has to give it a minute to charge the battery enough to start. And its a little cheaper than the competition with more CCA. Love the large display too"
4,So far a good product if you can figure out how to use all of the features.,2021/6/7,Over all it looks like a very professional product. My only issue is the instructions only cover jump starting and no other product features. It took me a while to figure out how to use the USB port and enable it. A Quick Start Guide would be a big plus.
5,Very Pleased,2022/3/3,"Chevy Silverado battery was completely dead. Knew I would replace the battery regardless but waited until I received my Hulkman85 so I could try it out. Charged it to 100% once I got it…took only a few minutes. Once I hooked it to my battery, it was ready in seconds. Truck crunk right up! Very pleased so far!!"
5,Daddy Likey!!!  THIS IS AWSOME,2021/10/15,"What can I say, I have van and forklift that I have to jump everyday.

I broke down and got this.. I will tell you its fantastic. Its a bit bigger that I thought it would be but it really really does the job.

The alligator clips that connect to the battery are really honestly the best alligator clips i have ever used in my life. On all the different jumper cables every, these are great.. Very well designed and built.. Feels super high quality and feels built to last with out needing any effort to open them, they just work!!

The thing came almost fully charged and I used it immediatly.. The instuctions we difficult for me, i figured out just hold down both buttons till it says READY then its ON and good to go.

I love it!"
3,Did not meet expectations,2022/1/11,"This would be a good product for recharging phones and laptops; starting a vehicle,  not so much. Tried starting a 2 liter gas vehicle - nothing. Charger was fully charged and ready to go. Controls are great, nice display, but it was purchased to start vehicles, and it fell short."
5,Extra Power when needed,2021/7/10,"Power available when needed.
Ive been fortunate not to need it to jump start my truck, but I feel better knowing I can if needed. Trying to find another car to give a jump sometimes is hard.

Currently, I use the battery pack to power my Laptop when Im outside working. I have a 12volt adaptor for my Laptop, I plug it into the battery & get an extra 1 - 1 1/2 hrs extra time to work.
The battery pack still has 50% power left if I need to jump start truck.
I bring the pack in at night to recharge when I do this."
5,A tool you can count on more than the vehicle it’s stored in,2021/12/18,"As someone who travels for overlanding and camping quite often this has been a must-pack accessory for every trip. It’s saved me and other likeminded explorers, the expense of a tow truck and offered us peace of mind in areas automotive service responders might not be able to reach. To think that this one tool can offer a full charge for a phone or laptop in an emergency, a jump start of a larger vehicle and a flashlight all at less than the cost of one phone call to a roadside service company let alone taking up a fraction of the space that traditional jumper cables do well justifies the purchase!"
5,Very Impressive Performance,2022/1/22,I got the Hulkman a couple of weeks ago and just had a chance to use it for the first time today.  Someone had a dead battery in a Jeep Grand Cherokee at the local gas station.  We connected the Hulkman up and it started right up the first time with no hesitation.  It only used about 1% of the batteries total capacity.The kit is nicely packaged in the box that it ships in with the accessories below the jump box.  It has a charger and the short jumper cables in the box.  You can easily fix the accessories back in the box and use it as your storage box.Pretty impressive so far.  It just seems to work exactly as advertised.  I like that it has a large LED display that shows the remaining charge.  I would definately highly recommend it.
5,First time using today...,2022/1/26,"As other reviews state...this thing feels solid. Purchased mine a month ago. Charged up in a couple minutes. Sat in vehicle under extreme cold conditions. Still had 100% charge this morning.

SUV wasn't turning over this morning due to sitting outside overnight with -9 air temp. Battery is probably a couple years old. Hooked up the Hulkman, saw the green ""ready"" lit up, turned key over and bam...fired right up. Used a whopping total of 2% of it's power in the effort. So far I'm loving this thing!"
5,"Easy to use, reliable",2022/4/11,"Great product, easy to use. Hard to write a review on one of these til you use it. I’ve used it twice now, both times on larger SUV’s. One wasn’t completely dead, and fired right up. The second was was an Escalade which was unable to be cranked wirh jumper cables. I offered to let him use my Hulkman and it cranked right up first try. It may be likely he got some charge from the initial attempt with jumper cables. Nonetheless, this device worked flawlessly. I still had 90%+ charge after each time. I’ve owned others that didn’t do what was advertised. I had two people wanting to know more about the unit and were sold on them. I bought one for my son too who is a new driver to keep in his car too."
,,,"Soldi davvero spesi bene, soprattutto quando sei fermo con la macchina ...
Peccato solo che la custodia costi 1/3 del caricatore...
Assolutamente da avere."
5,Awesome,2022/2/26,"The Hulkman alpha85 jump starter did exactly as it says it will do! I had a dead battery in my truck and ordered this online and They delivered in the middle of the night.
It started on the first try. I charged the starter for 10 minutes and it was fully charged!!! Worth every penny! Definitely buy it"
,,1900/1/22,Prodotto eccezzionale. Sono rimasto stupito dalle potenzialità. L'ho fatto vedere e provare all'elettrauto dove mi servo ed è rimasto meravigliato tanto che lo ha ordinato immediatamente.
5,This has a lot of power,2021/7/14,"Our RV lost power because the coach batteries were low and drained off the Ford E450 battery. Someone tried offered to jump start us but his small Toyota truck could not  get enough power to our battery to make anything happen. I hooked up the Hulkman Alpha85 Jump Starter 2000 mAh and our engine started immediately. Due to the super dead state of our battery, we had to use the Hulkman about 10 times. It still had 45% of its power after the 10 jump starts. Very impressive. And it recharges quickly!"
,,1900/1/22,"A dire al vero l'ho usato per il trattorino da giardinaggio che anche se il motore è piccolo ha bisogno di potente spunto per avviarsi.
Ben fatto sicuramente, lo proverò sul camper appena possibile"
5,"Very substantial unit, charges quickly",2021/2/23,"I decided I didn't want to be caught flat-footed again if my battery died, so I bought this unit.  It seems really well built, very substantial, but haven't had a chance to use it yet (thank goodness!)  The only thing missing is a case so I bought one of the Aproca cases that others have mentioned.The unit charges very quickly through the wall charger/usb-c charger.  I mean it was about 60% charged when it arrived and within 20 minutes it was up to 100% - that's how fast it was.  Altogether, I think it was a very good purchase."
,,1905/7/14,"ricaricato cellulare, ottima pila, Non provato per avviare l'auto ma credo che vada bene
Prodotto ottimo"
5,"If my wife can use this , anyone can",2021/10/16,"Buy this! Every car should have one. started our completely dead battery within seconds.  multiple times. Most recently, after our battery dying, and starting with the hulkman, we got our battery replaced. Its a new mini van and still under warranty so they just swapped out the battery for us. a couple days go by and my wife was leaving work when she discovered her new battery was dead also. she was freaked out.  I told her the hulkman was still in the car and not to worry. I had to instruct her how to open the hood, find the battery and ultimately hook up the hulkman for charging.  It was so easy to use she was able to get her car started within minutes of finding out it was dead. she was absolutely ecstatic! she came home and the first thing out her mouth was...everyone should have a hulkman in their car, its a no brainer. If your in the fence about what to buy. This thing is legit. you won't be disappointed.  I bought the 8.5 version."
,,,Funziona benissimo. L'ho appena usato sul mio camper 2.8 Diesel... Lo ha fatto partire subito... La batteria era a terra.
,,1905/7/14,Spedizione super veloce è arrivato in pochissimo tempo. Testato subito senza ricaricarlo su batteria scarica l’auto si è avviata senza problemi l’avviatore era al 85% ed è passato al 82% dopo l’avviamento. Ottimo prodotto!
5,Totally impressed !!!!,2021/8/17,"Small but powerful unit. Received it an it had 76 percent change, took about an hour to charge to 100 percent. Took the jump pack out to garage and started up my 67 Chevelle 454 big block, which had a completely dead battery, twice (wow). Unit still had 89 percent.  Started up two other cars with totally dead batteries, Cadillac 4.9 and Dodge 3.5, started with no issues. Pack still at 80 percent. Just wish it came with a case, otherwise awesome product. Important note, read directions for use when battery is totally dead, unit will error out and you need to press and hold buttons to clear error in order to start your car."
,,1905/7/14,Per il momento è perfetto ho fatto partire un auto con la batteria completamente scarica ottime finiture funzionamento facilissimo lo consiglio
5,Super High Quality - Everyone should have one,2022/1/3,"I have jumped my 8 cylinder F-150 five times and used 15% of the battery.  It got me to the store to get a replacement without a big deal.  It is super quick - safe - i got them for every car in the household.A dead battery goes from a giant pain in the ass to a 3 minute fix.  The ""peace"" of mind in knowing it is there and that it lasts 18 months makes it worth it."
,,1905/7/14,"Ho testato il prodotto su di un BMW Serie 1 (118d) con batteria totalmente andata.
In più, ho effettuato un test rimuovendo i cavi dalla batteria.

Risultato: avvio del mezzo sempre riuscito e sempre al primo colpo.

In definitiva, il prodotto funziona!"
,,1900/1/22,Usato con risultato ottimo- e la batteria rimane carica - batteria molto carica
,,1905/7/14,"Il prodotto è fatto molto bene . Per il momento non ho ancora avuto modo di provarlo , ma secondo me è validissimo , l'unica pecca , potevano metterci la custodia spendendo qualcosa in più . Complimenti ad Amazon, consegnato il giorno dopo."
,,1905/7/13,SEMBRA UN BUON PRODOTTO NON ANCORA TESTATO PERCHE E' UN REGALO DI NATALE
,,1900/1/2,"Ottimo prodotto: ben costruito, potente e duraturo, ma, appena si scarica, non funziona più.
Comunque, nel complesso, consiglio l'acquisto."
,,1900/1/22,"peccato non averlo comprato prima,è indispensabile"
,,1900/1/22,"Prodotto sopra alle aspettative, ha avviato senza nessuna difficoltà un trattore a cingoli del 1980 di 3400cc diesel. Sono davvero stupito. Lo consiglio anche per grandi cilindrate"
,,1905/7/14,"l'ho utilizzato per far partire un toyota rav 4, 2.5 hibrid con batteria a zero è ha funzionato perfettamente"
,,1905/7/14,Molto potente. Sì è inserita una funzione di protezione contro il surriscaldamento per avere provato un avviamento continuo per molti secondi. Critico solo l'impossibilità di trovare il case originale su Amazon
,,1905/7/14,"Non ancora utilizzato
Ma sembra un ottimo prodotto"
,,1900/1/2,

,,1900/1/22,Ok prodotto 👍
5,Powerful product,2022/4/26,"Purchased to start a van that had been sitting for 3 months, the battery had at best 1.2V.  Charging mode did not recognize the battery to stay on to charge.  Used the Jump mode, van started right up.  Received at 80% charge, ran down to 58% after jump start.  Surprised that the unit charged to 100% in about 5 minutes  on AC charger.  This is a keeper. Purchased the case the next day."
,,1900/1/2,ottimo
5,LEGIT!,2021/4/28,"This joint is probably one of the best out within its field. Charges really fast, and when jumping car batteries it works effortlessly. Its almost too good to be completely honest, I feel like I'm being punked into thinking things could actually do what the manufacturers claim they can do, however this one does. With the addition to the auxiliary features (solid, flashing, SOS and hazard lights, as well as charging ports for other devices, cell phone, laptop whatever, and then the 12V connector) its definitely a piece everyone should have in their trunk! BRAVO Hulkman, BRAVO!!!"
,,1900/1/22,"Grande potenza,usato per avviare un pick-up Ford con batteria completamente scarica.Avviamento ok con un residuo del 89% della batteria."
5,Overall size of this unit so easy to store in a vehicle,2022/4/10,"I like that it will hold a charge so long without having to keep plugging it in, recommending a top off charge of every 3 months if not used and it charges fully with in an hr if used. I have yet to use it, which is a good thing but its good to know its with me and ready to go whenever i need it. Definitely gives peace of mind and is so easy to store. The only thing i would suggest is that the manufacturer had designed a carrying case for this product as mine is stored in the original box altho mine is stored in the cab if my f150 so there isnt any chance the original box will get wet and ruined."
,,1905/7/14,"Prodotto molto facile e intuitivo, design bellissimo e materiali resistenti"
5,Well designed,2022/2/25,"Arrived with 80% charge, and only took 15 minutes or so to charge to 100%.  Great display with large numbers and numerical values rather than a series of lights.  All needed peripherals.  Looks like a lot of care went into design of this booster."
,,1905/7/14,provatelo se cercate un boostre di qualità!!
5,Better than those heavy jump box. A must for every vehicle,2021/3/24,This is a must have for everyone. My Bmw was sitting for a few months and the battery was DEAD. Hook this beast up to it and it started up with no problem. Next day it wouldn't start and my wife had the hulkman in her car at work so I had to use jumper cables and it took at least 5mins b4 it had enough charge to start. So jumper cables took about 5mins and hulkman 5seconds. After 1 jump from the hulkman for a car that was sitting for a few months it still had 94% left. I've since brought the more for the kids and wife care
,,1905/7/14,"Prodotto valido, provato su Alfa 156 2 serie diesel 2000cc."
5,Solid...works as expected.  Needs to include a carrying case.,2021/12/27,Had a dead battery and initially bought the Anker jump starter from BB.  Wouldn't even turn over.  Grab this on Amazon based on the great reviews and expedite same day Prime delivery.  Charged it until it was 100%.  Turn on the force start mode since my battery was completely dead.  Car started effortlessly with one try.  Battery when down to 72% so could probably due a few more dead battery jumps.  This thing rocks!  Only thing is I wish it came with a carry case.
,,1900/1/22,"Prodotto ben costruito, materiali assemblati egregiamente."
5,One of the Three Greatest Inventions of Western Civilization,2022/5/19,"Along with the electric garage door opener and peanut butter filled pretzel bites.  The Hulkman has bailed me out twice.  I own a Toyota Prius, which I occasionally fail to shut down properly - if you're a Prius owner, you know what I mean.  An incomplete shutdown means the battery can drain below starting capacity very quickly, so the Hulkman now goes everywhere the Prius goes.  Jump starting the car only drains about 15-18% of the Hulkman's charge, and the recharge rate on house current is very fast.  This unit also great for filling air mattresses and kiddie pools, and comes with every adapter I can imagine needing.."
5,Jump starting couldn't be easier!,2021/10/5,"With these jumper cables, there's never any fiddling about with turning the power on or hoping the car will start. When you clip them to the battery, the green light means you're good to go. No more worrying about the lead acid self discharge or the big bulky weight of the old jumpstarter.  As long as there's at least a little voltage on your battery, you're ready to go in seconds.  The obvious drawback is if you don't have a battery, or it's dead as doornail."
5,Jump start easy and didn’t have to call AAA!,2021/11/19,Great product. Wish I had known about this earlier. I would have taken it with me on road trips. It charges quickly from a three prong outlet. Lights up so you can see things in the dark. My Miata was really dead so it took a little time to turn the engine over but it did the job. I don’t have to call the auto club anymore! Only bad thing is that it doesn’t come with a case so I kept the original packaging. It’ll stay in the car.
5,Best jump starter i have ever used!,2022/5/23,"I work at a dealership and i use this Hulkman 8.5 Jump starter several times a week. It is a champ, will go several weeks on a single charge. And will start up high tech cars with big AGM batteries with no struggle at all. The battery can be completely dead as a stone and it'll crank it over like it had a brand new battery plus extra boost. This jump starter is amazing, it has outperformed 3 different jump starters at my shop. It wasn't on sale when i bought it, but for the price right now it is definitely worth the $110. Just buy it, you won't be sorry. I've had this little thing since February and i have 2 other co workers that want to buy this same one because of how impressed they are with how powerful it is. Best jump starter i have ever used"
5,Jeep jump start an drive.,2022/1/29,"I love this Hulkman. The first time I used it was on my brother Jeep that was dead. He got a jump from someone before I got to him, but the Jeep ended up dying again. I get to where ever he end up dying. Pull out the Hulkman from my truck. He’s like that little thing is going to jump my Jeep. I said he’ll yes! Jeep started up with power, but died a minute after I disconnected it. We ended up using the Hulkman as a battery to keep the Jeep running for 2.5 miles where the garbage was to has it checked an fixed the next day. Turns out the alternator went. This portable unit puts out so power."
5,Works fantastic!,2022/2/5,"While I am unable to speak to its longevity due to only owning it about a month, it worked perfectly when our friend’s car battery died. It only used 3% to jump it from completely dead.

The speed charger that comes with it is INCREDIBLE. It took all of 15 minutes to charge it to a full battery after I initially got it. It was on 83% coming out of the box. I have not charged it in about 3 weeks(since we jumped our friend’s car) and it’s still on 100%."
4,Cost Skyrocketed Over4 The Last Few Months,2022/1/20,I bought one of these in May of 2021.  I have only used it for jumping a lawn tractor and it worked extremely well for that.  I live in Minnesota and this has been in my vehicle for several months with no action.  I decided to bring it inside to check the charge.  Still at 100%.  Impressive.  The bummer....I decided to buy another for our second vehicle.  Last May I paid $79 for this...NOW IT IS $139!!  I passed.
5,Great jump starter,2021/11/24,"I bought 1 for myself to use at my farm to start my trucks and tractors. I was hesitant at first because of it’s small size of it compared to dewalt  or Napa ones I see at the store.  I got it and it seemed toughly built. I used right away on my farm truck that had a bad dead battery and it even has a mode to start batteries that need replaced. It worked! It’s a small unit,but roughly built you get many jumps out of 1charge. I love it so much I got 2 more as gifts for my dad and friend. I recommend this starter. Does the same job as a $200 big one from Napa."
5,This thing is NICE,2021/11/3,"Something is going on with my car where it dies if I let it sit for a couple days. I’ve had to call AAA several times and finally decided to just purchase a battery jump starter. I got us a couple days later and was really shocked by how nice this was built. The charger feels like really great quality, the cables are very nice and it came with a few attachments for other purposes. I’ve use this to jump my car about five times and it has worked flawlessly. Really impressed with the company built us."
5,THIS THING IS AMAZING!!!!!!,2021/10/21,"Seriously i dont get how this is not a 5 star all the way through, this thing is a life saver and has not failed once. I got the 8.5L even though im only using it for a tacoma and a honda accord. But this thing works flawless, starts right out the box and even at 75% worked like a champ for a road trip and saved from having to buy a battery after it was drained from leaving a light on.

5 STARS!"
2,Wont allow more than a few seconds of cranking,2022/2/7,"Has a lot of power to crank an engine over with but if youre like me and working on machines that are hard to start this booster pack will get aggravating, it goes into a safe mode if you crank on the machine for more than a few seconds at a time and you have to wait 10 minutes for it to clear before resuming cranking. For some this might not be an issue but for me the vehicles and machines don't typically fire right up so I've got to continuously crank trying to get them to turn over and this booster will not allow that. I'm sure its a safety thing added into it so you don't hurt something but its a pain in the butt for me."
5,A very solid option for quick jumps!,2021/7/23,"Perfect Jump Starter! Definitely a great value! I bought this, and as soon as I pulled it out of the box it was ready to jump my truck off with a battery that's been dead for several weeks. The display is awesome. The LED light functions are a neat feature. I'm sure I'll use it to charge my phone or some other device with the many plugs it has. It includes a USB-C cable, and a cool adapter for items that have ""cigarette lighter"" style plugs. Fits conveniently inside my glovebox with all accessory cables. Small, but very well built and has good ""heft"" to it, not a flimsy little item."
5,Most useful thing I've bought online. Works great in a very hot climate,2021/8/9,"I've used this 4 times to jump my Lexus , which is rarely driven. Granted I should buy a battery tender but this little thing is still at 72% after 4 jumps. I've had it about 3 months, and bought another for my Hyundai.

I have used this to force start a completely dead battery but unless you keep the engine at higher than idle the alternator isn't going to run the car. I've never seen any device jump start a car with a completely dead battery.

So easy to use.
I'm really pleased with this ."
5,"Super powerful , beyond worth it , holds a charge for what seems for  an eternity!",2022/1/19,It’s super powerful holds a charge forever and jumps dozens of cars and trucks with out even going below 50% power ! Always starts the car on first crank regardless of how long it’s been dead or how dead it is ! This jump box is an absolute monster and I would recommend everyone to have one in their car so they can drive with peice of mind and I even use the super powerful flashlight on the device all the time and it’s super bright and works amazing and does not drain the battery hardly at all !!!! Great product anf I was in the car biz for 20 years and owned I dealership and I wish I had one of these from day one ! Would have made my life a shit load easier and quicker to help people and to jump all kinds of cars trucks and SUV’s !!!!
1,Not useful for jumping SUV's,2022/1/31,"I own a 2007 Hummer H3 and used my Hulkman in an attempt to start my vehicle last week. I would not recommend this for anyone who wants a portable battery jump starter. It didn't have enough juice to start my Hummer, despite discharging all its power into my battery. I was lucky that the guy who parked next to me waited to see if I could start my Hummer before leaving and was able to give me a jump.
However, I do see no issue with this item being used to recharge smaller electronic devices since it does have a USB port, and other accessories for such uses. Just not jumping cars."
5,Wish I had one of these years ago!,2022/1/8,"I hate going to the dealership without an appointment and noticed my car was having trouble starting so I made a weekend appointment. I ordered this just in case so I wouldn’t need to ask for a jump and it arrived quickly which worked out because I needed to use it two day once my car wouldn’t start. It worked like a champ! So simple, I charged it and used it at least six times and each time the car started immediately!

I have three older children and wish I had this when they first started driving because all of them have needed a jump at one time or another.

We plan to go camping this summer so I am excited to see how this does using it to charge phones or as a light as well.

Great buy!"
5,Exactly what I needed.,2021/8/20,"I bought this to keep in my wife’s SUV. Wanted something light weight, easily stored and simple to use. It is all of these.
Her vehicle has an uncanny ability to chew through a battery and has already needed a Jump. She boosted a friends car at work, and oddly enough, my own battery died last week and we used it again. After three jumps and the third being a 6.4 liter engine, the device was only down to 87%.
I would recommend. Will be getting for my daughters as well."
1,Unfortunate purchase,2022/1/24,"Was excited to purchase especially for safety sake. Shortly after purchase, I was remote camping, it was 15F overnight and when I attempted to start the SUV’s engine in the morning, there was no action. Confidently, I pulled out the charger. It was charged at 100%. Attempted to boost the engine several times with NO success. The charge’s monitor told me that the engine battery was code 2 = dead. The charger was useless for me. Fortunately, another camper came by and agreed to boost my battery from his truck engine. That solution worked immediately at first attempt. Definitely NOT impressed with this jump starter."
5,Best for the money,2021/2/1,"I looked and compared products and found that the HULKMAN Alpha85 Jump Starter 2000 Amp 20000mAh Car Starter would handled anything that I have or would ever have. The quality is top shelf and it does what it says it will do, I reached out to the company to find a carrying case for it and said they would have one available around March time frame, I'm looking forward to see that. The price is not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and when you need one of these you always forget about the price and just want it to work."
5,THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!!!!,2022/3/24,"Took it out of the package, plugged in to charge and it was ready to go in 10 minutes.UNBELIEVABLY, the next morning, my daughter's car would not start (passenger door was ajar all night).We usually call AAA and it becomes a big hassle.  I kid you not:  I put the HULKMAN to the test and it was soooo easy- just clip them on-- directions everywhere to guide you-- and my daughter's car started right up! The entire ""jumpstart"" took 5 seconds!!  I bought one of these for all my kids and now I have such peace of mind!!  Stop searching:  this is THE one to get!!!"
5,Buy it,2021/11/15,"My buddy bought one and it looked interesting, but it wasn't until my old jump box finally gave up that I bought a hulkman for myself, and I love it! Its portable size makes it great for transport. Using it as an external battery back for my go pro to do time lapse videos make it worth it alone. Receiving it makes you feel like a million bucks too because the box and extra accessories look top notch. Absolutely love it and recommend!"
5,Ready when you are,2021/12/18,"It came safely, beautiful piece of equipment, charged it and visited all my friends with vehicles in storage.
I was able to jump 6 vehicles no problem I've run out of cars to jump I'm going home. I couldn't find a case to secure it in so I got creative for 23 dollars I purchased eylar case its a beautiful friendship, keep your investment safe and dry I really love this case as much as I love this jump starter."
1,Barely lasted a month,2021/11/6,Junk stay away.  A month old and it stopped working comes up with an error light every time I try to use it.
5,Absolutely amazing how well this works!!  Lifesaver!!,2022/5/10,"Bought this June 7th of 2021.  I have a car that sits in an airport parking lot for months at a time.  Flew down to the airport, totally dead battery.  Popped the Hulkman on and it fired it right up.  That was last June.  Fast forward to today, May 10th 2022, I left the fully charged Hulkman in the airport car.  The car was deader than dead.  I figured the Hulkman would be dead too.  It still had 85% charge on it!!  Fired the car right up like the battery was new.  Took 9% of the Hulkman to do it but that is still so amazing!! Can't say enough good things...."
5,Well made product,2021/12/14,"I have not had a need or occasion to use this booster. I have used the LED lights and charged my phone with it a couple of times and I did so without a issue. It is a sturdy, well built item. I fully charged it 2 weeks ago and it still shows a 100% charge. The true test will be when I need it that it works. I have given the hulk an a85 a five star rating thus far but if I need it and it fails I will re-rate accordingly."
5,Really works well!!!,2022/1/3,"Got to -14F here in Minneapolis last night and my battery was dead-dead-dead. Only sound I got was a couple of clicks, then nothing. I connected the Hulkman (which I had never used before) and my 10 year-old Lexus fired right up. I'm very happy."
5,Love this thing!,2022/1/2,"You know that helpless feeling when your car battery is dead and you have to wander around hoping a kind stranger will help you out? NO MORE! Be self sufficient with this awesome little jumper.
Bonus: charges phones, for all you reckless individuals who let your phones die while not near a power source. Probably don’t wanna carry this guy in your purse though."
5,Customer service is second to none,2021/12/15,I couldn't get the item to work.  I am unsure if I was in error or the battery jumper. I contacted the company regarding the issue and within a day I was offered a refund.  This company cares. Would I recommend this company.....? Heck yes. God bless and Merry Christmas
5,Gets the job done,2022/4/6,Saved me today! Used about 7% to start a pickup with a very weak battery.
5,Get it before you need it,2022/1/11,"I got this after my car died in a parking lot. I didn't have jumper cables and my phone had died. A stranger showed up with a device like this one. I bought one, charged it and threw it in my trunk. Shortly after that I was able to rescue a car that had been sitting in a garage for months. There was no way we were going to get another car nearby to jump it. The car was so dead we had to use the special override buttons, but it worked! Such a relief!"
5,Great new invention!!,2021/8/8,Well the first unit I got did not work correctly.. the meter would drop 10% in 2 minutes when I plug the cell phone in.. I contacted customer service and they told me to return and they would rush me another product.. I had it the next day and it is working fine.. I did get to use it yesterday finally.. my brother has a Chevy suburban with a 6.0 l V8.. the battery was totally dead.. I had to go through the forced start method..(thats in your little manual if you will read it) it started this big V8 like it had a brand new battery in it... I disconnected the unit and the vehicle died.. again I had to restart.. I left hope man hooked up for a few minutes.. and removed it and the vehicle kept running.. I would highly highly recommend this product if you do not have a jump box that works.. my whole family will be getting these for Christmas this year!!!
5,Unbelievable Performance! Its a BEAST!,2022/3/9,"So far I used the Hulkman to start a Toyota Tundra, Lexus iS300, and Ford Explorer. All fired right up with no hesitation. Unit was still at 97% after all 3 starts. Easy to use. I should have bought one sooner and save myself the headache of using a jumper cable and asking another person for a jump. Time saver and convenient. Simple storage in the trunk of your car. Will fit in a large glove box but will be tight with all the accessories it comes with. The Hulkman case securely holds the unit and accessories. I'm extremely satisfied with the performance and quality of this Hulkman. Great purchase!"
5,Best jump starter ever,2022/5/15,"The best thing about this starter is that it holds it charge for up to a year. I have used mine about 5 or 6 times so far starting other peoples cars, mine uses about 10% of its charge per jump. It took 15 min to recharge from 50% to 100% thanks to the 65 watt charger. I like that I can leave it in my trunk and not worry about it, then when I need it, it is ready to go, unlike other jump starters i had in the past where after sitting for a few months in car battery losts it charge and failed to perform when I needed it most. Great jump starter to carry in your car or your wife’s car and will work when you need it! It’s small and lightweight . 10 stars!!! Worth every penny!
Don’t forget to pickup a case for it."
5,Amazing!,2021/7/9,"Worked like a charm on a car battery that was past dead and had a bad computer chip! I only had the 2014 Dodge Journey about 10 days when the battery died. It was my son's dad idea to buy it, and I'm glad he did. I had to use it for over a week until we could get an appointment to have the battery replaced, as you have to take the wheel well off. Which is why we had no idea there was a computer chip dangling. The Hulkman never let me down! Started every time! Thank you Hulkman!"
2,Would not help car start with low battery,2022/2/10,"I used this in am today to help my car start. My car has been giving a slow start in am. It's cold. It actually made things worse. Car would not start. Removed it and car was able to start?
Update on this review. After contacting seller I was provided a new unit. A better version of the jump start and it is working great. Great seller and service. Thanks"
5,Reliable and easy to use battery jumper.,2021/5/30,I bought this because I’m having some type of electrical problem causing a parasitic drain on my battery... particularly when my fuel level is low. (If anyone wants to diagnose this feel free to chime in 😅 i can’t get into the shop til next week). Anyway. I bought this to get me through until i could get on the schedule at the dealership. It has worked 10/10 times and I’ve had to use it 6-7 times. It’s very easy to use and self explanatory. Everyone should own one of these!
5,Safety features and easy to use!,2022/3/7,"My sister bought it on sale and she loves it! I do to, I used it once and it was dark and I mixed the cables by mistake and the screen told me I made a mistake. So Im super glad it told me, I also used the light it has, as I forgot it had that lol I highly recommend it! Such a deal when we got it for less than $120 as some can cost much more."
,,1900/1/2,"Funciona perfecto, no hemos tenido problemas en cuanto al funcionamiento. Además el tamaño es práctico"
5,Incredibly Effective,2021/7/9,"I was able to start a completely dead (sitting for about six months) car battery in less than a minute. I did have to bypass the safety, but I cannot emphasize how easy and quick this product makes a jump start. Definitely easier than jumping from another car and can be done solo."
,,1905/7/13,Bello a vedersi.... Economico e funzionale.... Se avesse avuto anche una custodia sarebbe stato perfetto!
5,This has been a life saver!!,2021/8/22,"Since I've been working from home, I don't drive my 1999 car very much,. I was needing a jump a couple times a month. My car was completely dead(about a week) when I got the HULKMAN. I was hoping it would work ""as advertised"". It arrive charged at 80%,so I was able to use it right away. I did need to use the ""override"" twice, but it started!! This has been a life saver! Now, I don't worry about my battery dying, and for a female, that's a relief!"
5,Big and powerful. Can't beat this for the price.,2021/2/10,"This thing charges crazy fast. Came at 65% and was at 100% within 15 mins. Power to run accessories all day. Comes with cigarette lighter style plug to use 12v tools and accessories. Jumped started a battery from dead and barely dropped the units battery percentage.

This thing is a big unit...but then again you shouldn't be carrying it around in your pocket.

Very well constructed and feels solid. Large battery display is a great feature."
,,1905/7/14,"La manifattura, il prezzo basso e l'uso"
5,A great thing!,2022/3/29,"I really like this product.  It has come in handy twice already.  It is easy to use all around.  If there is one complaint, it comes in a rather fancy gift box that took a lot of thought and design but which is really useless.  It needs to come with a nice carrying/storage bag.  That said, that is a minor issue when you consider how cool the charger is otherwise. Happy motoring!"
2,Doesn’t work as advertised,2021/5/31,"I tried this charger, which was 100% charged on 2 different boats which had dead batteries. It didn’t start either V8 engine. Now to be fair, both of these boats had dual battery systems, which I don’t know why that would make a difference. It did however start a little 2 cylinder 4 wheeler. I would have returned it but i left it in Louisiana."
,,1905/7/14,"Ottimo prodotto ,facile da usare specialmente per una donna ,lo consiglio"
1,Buyer beware chances are you'll receive a defective unit,2022/4/19,"I ordered this charger after all the positive reviews on Amazon and on review sites. The unit arrived today at 0% charge so I plugged it in to charge it up and it charged until all the menu items on the LED screen were flashing. When I try to turn on the unit, all the icons just flash. When I try to turn on the LED again all the menu icons just flash. There is little to no support on their website nor in the instruction manual provided with the unit or online.

Buyer be advised that it looks like I am not alone in receiving a defective unit. I will be returning this ASAP.

05/04/22 Edit:
Seller reached out in good faith and sent a replacement unit that appears to be working so far, I have not had a chance to jump start a car but the menu flashing and the LED lights not working issues have been resolved."
5,Worked well on completely dead battery!,2022/1/6,"I left my dome light on for several days over the holiday, and my battery was completely dead. The Hulkman started my crosstrek up with no problem. Because the battery was so depleted, I had to use the ""force"" feature to get the unit to recognize that it was connected, but it worked as explained. Even though the Hulkman had been sitting in the car for more than two months since I charged it, it was at 100% charge. Starting the car took that down to 95%.

This is a great product! It's so small that it takes up no space at all, and gets the job done."
,,1900/1/22,"Para arrancar el coche, siempre a mano"
5,Fan-flippin-tastic,2022/2/10,Used on my one week old dead drained battery for my 2007 car. Had to use the force start feature where you hold down both buttons at once. Started it up right away. Took about 26% of its battery life. Not a big deal at all. Charged it back up and it’s ready to go again. Product is really well-made. Feels heavy and thick. Very pleased with this.
5,BEST IVE EVER HAD,2021/11/8,"I have a 2015 gmc terrain. As a single woman I'm ALWAYS concerned abt my car breaking down and bring stuck somewhere and over paying for help.
While I have AAA, sometimes I want to be self sufficient.
My battery died and I was FAR from any main roads...I jumped my car with this and it was QUICK and easy..
IM IMPRESSED...it charges quickly, the digital display is big and the flashlight changes into 6 different patterns to alert for help and help you see..
A must have for all !!!!"
,,1900/1/22,Non è robetta scadente cinese. 👍🏻
5,Bang for the buck,2021/9/6,Got this as a backup for our 1998 Cabrio with a weak battery and that we seem to always leave the lights on in. I’ve jumped the thing 3 times and it only uses 2% of the charge per jump! For the price it seems like super good quality and it couldn’t be easier to use. It’s not as small as some others I’ve seen but I think it holds significantly more charge so it’s a sacrifice I’m okay with.
5,So Impressed,2021/12/16,"My sons car wouldn’t start one morning and fortunately for us his car decided to misbehave while at home sitting in our driveway. I hooked up my multimeter to test the battery and it had about an9v charge. So I decided to look for a product to jump start our car. Not only for this one time but I wanted a device that would provide added safety and protection for years to come. Based on all of the great reviews of the Hulkman Alpha 85,  I decided to purchase it. Once it arrived I hooked it up as instructed and received an error code 2 message. I looked it up in the user manual and it said my battery was low between 2-8v and to press the two buttons. Upon doing so the green ready light came on.  The car started up immediately!!!  I couldn’t be more impressed with how easy and effective this device is. I highly recommend it for everyone!!!"
,,1905/7/13,Ottimo acquisto.  Già provato e avviato senza problemi motore diesel 3000 cc
5,Quality you can see,2021/8/24,"I’ve not had the opportunity to use it but based on my initial observations it appears to be well made. The packaging was really nice and the components it came with seem high quality. The unit itself looks very sturdy and it’s contact points (buttons, switches) are quality and well made. I feel confident if I needed to use it, it would do it’s job but that remains to be seen. So far on aesthetics and feel I’m happy with my purchase."
5,This thing is freaking awesome.,2022/1/27,"The Hulkman has saved my bacon several times.  Car dead at the airport…Hulkman to the rescue!  Snowed a bunch and my lawn tractor I useFor plowing, was dead.  Hulkman to the rescue!  Generator battery dead, again Hulkman saved the day.  Literally the best hundred bucks I’ve spent in a while.  This thing has so much cranking power, engines just roar to life."
,,,"Semplicemente da usare ,robusto prezzo qualità prodotto"
,,1900/1/22,El producto llegó en buenas condiciones y a tiempo lo manda
5,Great product,2022/4/5,"I have a handful of toys and a riding lawnmower that go dead over the winter due to lack of use and jumping these is a pain.
Came on an 80% charge, hooked it up and was fully charged in like 60 minutes. My side by side battery was low and wouldnt start, hooked it up, it said ready, and it started right up. Only used 1% on the jump.
Ive had to jump the side by side 4 times and it only uses 1% per jump. The lawnmower was dead and it started right up as well. This is a good product."
5,Extensive research paid off,2022/1/23,"I’ve been looking for a jump pack for a long time, I finally went with this unit.
After running it through several scenarios it delivered.
The only issue I have is the clamps; the teeth aren’t so sharp and the springs aren’t very strong. They also don’t clamp on the side terminal bolts, but it works out if you clamp at an angle (see pic).
Yes it will jump a small block Chevy with a dead battery with ease. I actually used it to start one of my vehicles that did not have a battery, after letting the fuel pump run to pressurize the system it fired up.
And yes, I will buy another."
,,", 2022","SUPERO MIS EXPECTATIVAS,  BUEN PRODUCTO LO RECOMIENDO"
5,Just What I Needed Instant Jump Start,2021/12/11,"Glad I got this jump start with force start. One of our vehicles (2.4L Nissan Frontier) sits unused for extended periods and battery is always dying. Used this when it arrived on completely dead battery, worked perfectly. If not for the force start I'd still have the same problem of waiting to trickle charge to get going again. Hulkman works just as promised and very well made. Well worth every penny."
5,Must Have,2021/3/2,My car dies quite frequently within a month I have used this jumper 4 times now and the battery life on it is at 85%. One of the times I jumped me car it was completely dead. Even in the single digit temperatures we have had it still jumps my car in less than a minute. I read some reviews about not having a container or bag for the battery jumper and wires I just keep them in the original box and it has worked fine for me. I am beyond happy with this product and so glad that I got it.
5,Powerful but small car starter,2021/3/17,"Surprisingly smart and easy to use. I’ve only had the chance to use it twice but it started a Toyota with a 5.6L engine and also a lawn tractor (yeah, I know, the lawn tractor is small but it shows it can start most anything with a 12v battery).

The small size, the fast charging feature and the long-lasting charge make it great for just charging up and leaving in your vehicle in the winter if you’re worried about your car starting."
1,Doesn’t work,2022/2/7,I ordered this and had it overnighted because I’m having car trouble. I charged it to 100% as soon as I got it and went to use it on my Ford Explorer. It says the Ready light is supposed to come on but it’s not coming on. I hooked it up and left it for a long time and it still hasn’t worked. I don’t know if I got a defective one or if it’s just all around a horrible product.
5,Want one for the farm now!,2022/3/21,"We have used these to help jump start a 100 hp tractor with this on one battery and a plug-in charger/starter on the other. We've also used it to start a Polaris 500 4W when the battery was dead. However, it's usually used on my car for the few times I've had a dead battery. Just keep an eye on the charging level and plug it in every so often to keep it topped off."
5,Wow…,2022/2/25,I purchased this product because of the reviews. I had a slight issue after a month and a half. I must say the company’s response was quick… this is one of the best jump starters that I’ve ever had… they replace my jump starter right away. It’s worth the money. And three or four years from now if this is no good I will purchase again….
5,Easy to use,2021/5/5,"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It seems we have a problem with car batteries dying on us. As soon as I got it , I ran outside to hook up to a dead car battery and it worked like a charm! Car started right up, no long fussy cables, and best part; no need for  another car to jump start ya! Everyone should have one of these in their cars. Plus, it charges my phone! No more sitting in my car to charge my phone during a power outage."
5,Amazing tool and convenience,2021/1/18,I received this for a Christmas present and a few days later my father in law called and said that his forklift on his job site was dead and a worker had left the key on for 5 days. I took the hulk man over there and hooked it up. The jump pack displayed an error code and the instructions said the battery was so low it needed a boost which required the two buttons to be held down simultaneously. Within 5 seconds it started to my amazement. Large Diesel engine with totally dead battery. If it starts that I am confident it will start anything
5,Amazing!,2022/1/13,"After having major issues with my older car, and the battery continuously losing charge after a few days, and using up all my free calls to AAA in less than a month, I decided to invest in one of these while I wait for my new car. THIS THING IS AMAZING! I just did the initial charge (it comes mostly charged out of the box), and have already used it 4 or 5 times, mostly to start a totally dead battery, and it still has over 85% charge. It is so easy to use and takes only a few minutes, from pulling it out of the box and putting it back. Even though I’m getting a new car, I’ll always have one of these. So much easier, faster, and convenient than old-school jumper cables since you can do it alone."
,,1905/7/13,Prodotto consigliato molto potente
5,Worked great,2021/12/1,"Suspected my battery was going bad in my 6 year old crossover I use for daily commuting. Good thing too since I had to test this out just a week later. It started my car up immediately after connecting the jumpers to the battery terminals.

fyi, bought this higher capacity battery so I could also use it on my 1 ton pickup should the need ever arise."
,,1905/7/14,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.
5,Fast to charge and works every time,2022/1/27,"It has worked every time I’ve used it in the heat or cold I just leave it in the car. If the battery ever goes dead, it charges incredibly fast like in About 10 minutes it will be at 60% from zero. I never have gotten stranded using this or anybody around me that ever needs a jump I pulled this out and they’re ready to go. They always ask questions like where can I get it because it works so good. I even used it on my uncles 18 wheeler that was having trouble starting and a big Diesel air compressor we got at work starts just fine with the help of this. Is stays charged up sitting in my car and I only have to charge it after I’ve used it a lot. It also works fine on my 1990 fox body"
,,1905/7/14,Ottimo
5,Had it when I needed it,2022/3/20,"I received the unit at 80% charge.
Used it the next day before I even had a chance to look at it good.
I quickly reviewed the instructions then proceeded to jump start my truck that a grandson accidentally had left the key on all night and half the next day.
Long story short. It worked amazing.
Definitely a great purchase."
5,Why didn’t I get this years ago?,2022/1/10,"I wanted to replace the old “portable“ unit we had because it took forever. This just looked really handy. Pay attention to the reviews, because they are correct. I am not by any means car educated and I was able to jump my drained battery in 20 minutes from out of the the box to the cables. That includes charging it. What can I say? Buy this."
5,Works great,2021/12/5,"Bought this for my mother’s car which doesn’t get much exercise these days. I was able to use the forced output feature on a completely dead battery. It was very easy to use with instructions printed on the back label. The quality of the device, clips, and charger all feel well made and meant to last, and not some cheap crap that will die or fall apart after a couple of uses. I was able to walk my sister through hooking it up and starting our mother’s car over the phone. She loved this thing too and said she was going to order one for herself for emergencies."
,,1900/1/2,spettacolare
5,Awesome Product,2021/3/30,I was able to test this out on my car and it worked like a charm. My battery was completely dead so I had to hold the buttons on the device to push the charge. The instructions are really simple. It also does not take long for it to recharge. Better to have this on hand than waiting hours for someone to help.
5,Excellent modern battery starter,2021/5/7,"I love this modern high tech battery charger.  I used it twice on a BMW and it worked like a champ.  I drove the car to a shop to replace a bad battery.  It was simple and easy to use.  Am glad I bought it.  This replaced the old fashioned, weighs a ton, battery starter that sometimes worked.  The box it came in is very well made and engineered. Similar to an Apple box. Don’t hesitate to buy this one."
5,Best purchase in a long time!,2022/4/22,"I have a car that is stored over the winter months and kept on a battery tender. This year, the battery was dead when I went to get it out for spring. It is stored in a somewhat inconvenient place for jumping using a second vehicle. I purchased the Hulkman and it arrived the same day. I could not believe how quickly it charged to 100%! It was so easy to use and my car started with no problem on the first try! Looking forward to checking out it's other features."
5,This is a must have especially  during the cold days.,2022/1/25,"I like everything  about this jump starter. My battery was low had problems starting vehicle  on a  freezing cold day. Wow, this Starter was so easy to use,  the engine was running in a second it was connected to the battery. It has great safety features, has a case easy to travel with. Thank u. I love my Jump Starter."
2,Should have returned it,2021/8/1,"This is definitely portable and lightweight. I do really like that about it. However it just hasn't always been able to jump things,  especially if something is dead. I always get error messages. I had to buy another one, it was a schumacher. It will start a dead one.  This hulkman wont."
5,Works well as expected,2022/1/19,"* Came in a sturdy box for storage in a vehicle.
* Large, easy-to-read display and very simple operating instructions.
* Started my car from a completely dead battery; after that I only needed to attach the cables and start the car.
* Provided ample starting current; car cranked over immediately and started."
5,STILL THE BEST,2022/2/23,"You can't best a Solid 5 Star Review.
This Jump Starter is Pretty Awesome.
I PURCHASED it for My Wife in case she needs it and she's by herself.
(I don't have to Drive and jump- start the car anymore)
Best Money I've spent in a long time.
(Well next to the New Battery I had to buy)"
5,Technophobe friendly,2021/12/4,"I have a weird phobia of jump starting cars, which isn’t good when you’re an airhead (read: leaves lights on) who works odd hours in a sketchy area. I got this after missing an event due to dead battery and had the chance to use it a few weeks later. Worked perfectly and I was on the road in no time!"
5,"Hope it stays in the trunk with the spare,  but .......",2021/7/14,"I make deliveries all day,  sometimes I want to listen to my radio while I wait,  my car warns me about using the battery with the engine off,  I was concerned,  so I purchased this to keep in the trunk..  I believe it is well built,  it came partially charged,  I was able to charge it to 100 percent in very little time.  I read the instructions so I will be prepared to use it and stowed it with the spare time.  All in all I  am happy to know it is there if I need it or if I am ever in a position to help a stranded motorist."
3,Included charger has never worked reliably,2022/5/26,"This unit has worked to jump start my car and lawnmower the couple of times I've needed it. Unfortunately, the included charger, that advertises faster recharge rate, has never worked reliably. Now it seems to have completely failed. I can still charge, at a slower rate, with a standard USB 3 charger thankfully. But one of the advertised advantages of this over similar models is the faster recharge. I sent an email to their support, but not holding my breath on a response as others have been unsuccessful. I'll update if they respond."
5,Works best warm.,2022/2/16,This thing rocks when it gets below zero and your car battery won’t crank. However this particular unit needs to be kept in a warm place to be able to fully crank. When kept in the cold car it has the same problem as the car battery. Cold. The upgraded version Alpha 85s might be better as it has an internal heating unit I believe but cost more. This is why I only gave 3 stars for portability.
5,Works with dead batteries!,2022/5/12,"I have tried two other jump starters that would not work with an empty battery; this one does. You may need to hold down the two buttons for 3 seconds to make it work with a dry battery, but it is instant. It will say ready, turn the key, and BAM, you are off.

High quality.

They sell a version with the bag that was cheaper to buy as a bundle (wish I would have checked this first). If you plan on getting the carrier, check the price for the bundle to see if you save money over buying them separately.

I will update my review if I have issues, but so far, this looks like a winning purchase."
5,Life Saver,2022/4/28,"*Note* Hold BOTH buttons down at the same time if nothing happens when you connect the cables to your terminals. This is not clear on the device or even in the instructions. They should just have a separate button for a 'battery totally dead' super jump.

That being said, this is a reliable, well-made device. I have used it countless times for a new vehicle that has a mystery parasitic battery drain, which has been a nightmare, but having this with me at least allows me the security of always being able to get moving. Don't hesitate to buy"
5,Amazing,2022/1/10,"This jump pack has more bang in it than my full size plug in jump start machine. It is easy to use and very easy to store. As with most others, I wish there was a carrying case to at least store the accessories in. Other than that, amazing and convenient product. The internal battery seems to last forever. I have jump started about 8 different cars, charged my phone who knows how many times, used it as a flash light while working under a car and it still has 32% remaining. It’s like it doesn’t want to die."
5,Very Nice Product,2021/3/17,"After research, reviews, etc. The product appears to be what it claims.
Haven't had any dead batteries to test yet...But it looks nice, and feels well built.
The only thing this product needs, is it's own hard case.
Highly recommend.

Recommended case (ASIN: B081YGD6NH) - Khanka Hard Travel Case Replacement for Work Sharp Knife & Tool Sharpener/Ken Onion Edition (yellow zipper)."
5,Works great .,2021/8/15,"Came with 80% charge. Topped it off in just a few minutes.  Used it to start my case diesel forklift. Connected leads, unit recognized battery and ready.  Engine started immediately.  Only used 1%.Engine died after a short while, re hooked, had to use force start this time..  Engine fired on first try, and kept running this time.  Used 2% more. Unit at 97% after 2 uses.  So far so good."
5,Good design sturdy build,2020/12/19,"It’s sturdy builded and high quality , well designed. including 65W charger & alligator clips.
Highligh: 65W urgent charging for jumpstarting. it can charge to full capacity of battery in a hour(actually, fast charging is always bad to battery
life, use it only while necessary) I charged it by a 5W cellular phone charger through type C. It takes time but works.
The Display is clear and huge, easy to identify under sunshine.
Clip strength is good and open enough angle to hold battery terminals tightly.

Lowlight: probably need a storage bag but it’s not a big issue. Original box is good.
Have no chance to test it for jumping start. Based on the battery capacity, it should work.
Will test it later."
5,Not all jump packs are created the same,2021/3/16,Right away you can tell this jump isn't like most the wire used to make the terminal clamps is heavy duty most mini jump packs I've had used like a 12awg wire with 10awg insulation. The hulkman wires are at least 8awg if not 6awg it took less than 10 minutes to fully charge and I've started one 4.0l v6 with it so far without Breaking a sweat. One last feature not all smart packs have is the ability to turn the jump starter on  Manually without connecting to a battery meaning if some packs are connected to a very dead battery they will not turn on to start the car because they don't see any voltage hulkman can be turned on manually great feature
5,This thing is Kick-ass!,2021/6/1,"I bought this on sale for $95 dollars, and man that was one of the best purchases I've ever made. It has saved my skin, jump starting my work truck, which has a 6.0l gas engine. The battery on my ATV died , but with this jump starter in my truck, we were able to keep the party rolling, even after my friends kept stalling it. This is also an awesome battery bank to bring with you on trips, and after charging your phone, it'll still jump start your car no problem. While I wouldn't call it pocket sized, my work pants have big enough pockets that I can take this with me on the go. I haven't put a timer to it, but the 5 minute charging time isn't far off."
1,When your battery is died this jump cannot start your car,2021/5/6,"Very bad jump
When your battery is died this jump cannot start your car"
5,Very satisfied with this company,2021/7/27,Very satisfied with this Hulkman company. The first Hulkman I received had a few things that weren’t functioning properly but messaged the company after my return window had closed and they messaged me concerned about the issues. The company sent me a brand new Hulkman and not one issue with this new one. People are putting negative comments about the companies feedback but I did not have one issue. Definitely a product to consider works fabulous
5,Generally useful to have,2022/1/26,I personally haven't used this to jump my own car yet but I've helped others out with it. A couple associates under my watch at work have had some bad/old batteries so I'd help them jump their cars in a pinch and it has worked every time without a hitch. Otherwise I just use it as a massive battery bank that I keep in my backpack. The caps are hard to take off since they're so snug fit but I'd rather it be snug than loose. Overall its nice to have.
5,I was pleasantly surprised,2022/1/29,"I had a dead battery on my Kubota tractor  and I hooked the Hulkman jump starter to battery and it was better than I could believe. It is compact, it fits in a tool bag with the short cables and the charger. I now carry this in my car and I’ve retired my old jumper cables. I like every thing about it!"
5,"8 minutes outta of the box, car is running!",2021/5/7,"Car battery was dead yesterday from me leaving the lights on.  I order the Hulkman Jumpstart last night an just got it about 30 minutes ago.  Opened the box and was like wow packaging is cool, plugged in the terminal connectors and connected it to my batery as instructed.  Within like 5 seconds it showed "" ready"" with 89% charge capacity and I started my car right up!  I have it currently plugged in to chargecit and its already @ 96%!  This has to be one of the best products I have ever purchased on Amazon!  100% charged when I took the photo and finished the write up."
4,May not work with certain vehicles or dead  batteries,2021/3/21,It might have worked but it did not have enough power to overcome my cars factory anti-theft circuitry which needs to keep steady power on at all time to reset the anti theft system. I had to buy one that u plug in and keep on while u reset the anti theft thing. So I could not rate it accurately but if it had worked I would have given it 5 stars.
5,Will start a 3.6L V6 engine multiple times,2022/4/18,"Battery was completely dead and car was in a parking garage with no wall outlets anywhere nearby. This jump starter started the car within a few seconds and still had about 70% remaining. Used it twice more later that day because there was a problem with the alternator not charging the battery properly. After jump starting the car a total of 3 times, the this thing still had 30% remaining. 10/10"
1,Didn’t work,2021/10/27,I went to use the product ( when I actually needed it ) and it didn’t work. I ended up purchasing another brand at Walmart the same day. Unable to return for refund because it’s 20days past the date.
5,Works very well,2021/8/5,"READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  I had two cars that I hadn't used or turned on in over a year.  They were 100% dead.  No lights, no gauges, nothing. The batteries completely dead. I put the Hulkman on it and pushed the button which made it indicate the % of charge.  Hooked it to the battery and tried to start the car. Nothing happened. I went and read the INSTRUCTIONS and sure enough their are special instructions given for completely dead cars.  Tried it again the right way and each car cranked and started perfectly as if the battery wasn't dead at all."
5,Seller was amazing!,2022/3/1,"We had purchased this the end of Dec. after reading great reviews. I even bought the case for it which was another $50 to keep it safe. Unfortunately it was faulty and past the return window.

What I really appreciate is how professional and helpful the seller has been throughout this process. They made it right for me and provided me an upgraded replacement. This was a gift for my husband and not only am I happy that he has a replacement, I’m thankful he has a jumper that will be there for him when he needs it!

Many thanks to the HULKMAN Support team!"
5,Best Jumpstart Box I’ve ever used,2021/10/21,"I don’t write many reviews but this box is so good i feel like i have to.  My car has an electrical drain that i haven’t been able to diagnose yet, so leaving it for a couple days ends up with a dead battery.  I used to end up late to work once or twice a month because I’d have to wait for someone to help me jump, or the old jumpstart box i had wouldn’t work.  This thing has been a lifesaver.  If the battery’s not fully dead, i can just link it up and immediately start the car.  Even when the battery is fully drained, it just needs 10-20 seconds attached before it starts the car.  I haven’t tried it without a battery, but I’d imagine it works just as well.  I’ve used it probably 10-15 times since purchase and it’s been quick and reliable every time.  Definitely recommend buying."
5,Works perfectly,2021/6/22,"This really works great.  I woke up to a completely dead battery(totally my own fault)and had to get my wife to take me to work.  Luckily I was able to get this delivered the same day, and it was there before I got home from work.  Hooked it up and got the car started within minutes from completely dead.  I would highly recommend this product just for the peace of mind having it gives me."
5,Absolutely the best and a must have.,2022/3/4,Don't go anywhere without it. Will jump anything you got including big motors. Uses almost no power and holds its charge over 6 months easily. Get it for your friends and family for birthdays and keep it in your vehicle as great insurance! I have used it twice in the first few months of ownership.
4,Great jumper,2021/3/13,"Well its insurance that I keep in motorhome. Been a mth and used for a truck start next door. I know it's only been a month but it was at 100 % where used. Its also great as I'm always tinkering with 12 electric stuff, and the size and shape are very portable"
5,Great !,2022/4/24,"As a single woman, this was well worth the money. My car battery was going bad. It was night time and I went to the store and on the way back my car would not start. I did not need to ask anyone for help. Just popped the hood. Put this baby on and car started. Highly recommend especially for single women with no help."
5,"It showed up this morning, we started the car less than 10 minutes after it arrived.",2022/2/10,"While I would normally like to use a product of a period of time before recommending it, this product has already paid for itself in less than 12 hours.  I had a car that was in an awkward position to jump it using one of our other cars.  I did not want to push the car, and did not want to pay for a tow truck.  So I ordered this product.  It arrived in the morning.  I unwrapped it, and used it to start the car within 10 minutes (it arrived with a 78% charge).  Our vehicle battery probably needs to be replaced, but there was not any time to do that today.  So my wife headed off to her first appointment.  She was able to quickly jump the vehicle having watch me use this device once that morning.  Very convenient.  Very happy we purchased it."
5,A must for every car owner,2021/7/16,"Absolutely love this little gem. Started having intermittent issues with a 7 year old car battery,  I know it's getting replaced,  and ordered this just in case.  Well it came in handy a couple of times already. Extremely easy to use and fires right up. I didn't realize it at first but I also use it to charge up phones and I can even extend the life of my laptop."
5,Great product,2021/7/17,"Had a few months car was having battery alternator issues at time jumped my car @ 10 times with it works great charges insanely fast.  On my tacoma takes about 4% battery life to start truck..  Digital battery life readout is nice.Its small, light, easy to use.  If this thing lasts a few years I'd buy the same one again.  From the few months I've had it I highly recommend"
4,Works well once you figure a couple of things out.,2022/2/11,"The first time I used it, my battery was drained below the ""dead battery"" limit, so I had to use the force start feature.  Good thing I had the manual with me.  Once I figured it out, it started right up.  It is SO much more convenient that having to use jumper cables.  I've used it twice and I'm still above 90%."
5,Best ever!,2022/3/7,"I loved this product and it stays charged forever one day I was going in Walmart and saw this lady with her hood up to her Denali I said I have a jump box but not sure it’ll work on ya truck. She connected it and it instantly started up. I’ve used this on my sister dodge charger, Dodge Durango and my Range Rover. It’s been charged for months. Everyone see it and say that little thing not gone work and now they all call me to use my jump box. I send everyone this link and recommend this jump box over any!"
5,Impressive for such a small device,2021/3/26,"Very easy to use. I was able to jump start my truck without even charging it. It also charges very quickly too when needed. That, plus it's smallish form factor and other utilities like flash light and phone charger makes it a perfect companion for road trips. Its only drawback compared to my previous one is its lack of an air pump. But it's portability (and price) makes up for that."
5,Best battery product I ever had,2022/4/6,I bought this because my older one died after years of use.  I used this to charge my driving lawn mower and my old car when its battery died. I use it regularly to run my auto video recorder.  It has large capacity and charging very fast. It may be slightly pricy but you will not regret.
5,Easy to use and works great,2022/2/12,"Has very clear instructions, easy-to-read buttons / charging percentage / READY light, and safety caps on all ports.  I'm still doing the math on how something quickcharged with a USB-C port ended up jumping my 2000 Ford Expedition with a basically-non-existent battery and only used 5% of its energy to do so but - worked like a charm!"
5,It does everything and is powerful too.,2021/8/3,"I have been using an 800 CA jump box and it has been fine. But this is much better. Compact and powerful. It also can act as a 12v power source as well and a USB charger and a USB -C charger and power supply.

Great safety features built-in as well. Chargers very fast.

If it lasts a long time it is a great investment. -- Harry"
5,Great features and peace of mind,2022/3/7,"I've been wanting one of these to include in our main vehicle for awhile.  Along with a spare tire, roadside flares, and jumper cables (among other items) I feel more prepared in case something happens on the road. Haven't had the opportunity to try it yet. And it does charge quickly!"
5,Beast,2022/4/16,"This jump starter is incredible. Oddly enough, just after I purchased it, the battery in my ATV’s both went dead, and my tractor, then my car which had the trickle charger knocked off without knowing, killed my car battery. All we’re jumped within a week and I still have 82% lift on the Hulkman. LOVE THIS CHARGer"
5,Excellent!,2022/4/6,"You need this in your trunk.  This actually works better than a much larger ""jump box"" that I own.  I carry it in my tool kit in my Jeep. It's light and easy to pack. Excellent insurance for when you are alone and may need a jump. I highly recommend it. It could literally save your life."
4,Only rated to -4F,2022/4/20,I love this jump starter. Only complaint is that it is only rated to -4F. I live in N.D. and -4 in the winter is considered balmy. I recently purchased the 85s which is rated to -40F with their new heating technology. I guess I will give the 85 to my son in Oregon. Temps not nearly as cold there.
5,Starts your car right up,2021/10/11,"Had the ""opportunity"" to use this on our 2011 Volvo X60 and it worked GREAT! Battery had worn out (5+ years old) and hooked the Hulkman up and it started RIGHT away. Very cool that the screen says ""Ready"" after you hook it on to the battery. I will say it's not good to use as a phone or accessory charger, charges devices very slow and drains a lot of battery to do so. But of course this is a jump start pack - and for that it is PERFECT.

I hadn't charged it in eight months and it started the Volvo from a dead battery immediately and only drained 5% of its own battery. Very awesome, buying more for the rest of my vehicles."
5,So far so good,2021/10/22,"So far so good, but I only paid 80 bucks. It seems to have good digital features only minor complaint and I knew this when I bought it it is not come with a case of any kind someone offers that separately for $23
But yeah so far I really like it and think it was a good deal compared to the NICO or the leading brands"
5,Serious Jumpstarter,2021/8/7,"This thing is a freaking brick. The whole package is solid.  The cables that came with it were better than the ones I had with my car.  This unit is stupid easy to charge up and use.  It feels like if you knock it off your manifold by accident it’ll survive.  Hopefully I don’t have to use it much, but I’m confident when I do, it’ll be ready."
5,Life saver!,2022/3/10,"I wanted to buy one of these battery jump starter, ""just in case."" I paid around $100.- and yesterday I used it for the first time, It worked perfectly, just connect it to the battery and immediately it showed READY, I cranked the engine and Cowabunga!"
5,Works Great!,2022/3/10,I’m very impressed with this jump start. I have an older 24HP Diesel tractor with a battery that struggles in the winter - but this jumpstart spins it over easily. I’ve started the tractor four times with this so far and I’m still at 97% charge. I would recommend highly
5,Awesome battery,2021/8/16,"No, it's not light weight, but why would you want it to be? It's designed to jump a car. I used it on a Dodge Ram 5.7l V8 and it worked great. I love this thing, but no, you're not putting it in your pocket."
5,The best,2022/4/18,"Super convenient. My employer uses these and they’re often stolen. I opted to buy my own and it’s been worth every penny. I also transport cars, and this is very easy to carry. When I buy cars to flip, this is always with me. Just another tool in the arsenal."
5,Shocking,2021/11/22,"Used it right out of the box, by chance the day I received it I had to jump start 2 cars within 3 hours of delivery, worked perfectly and I'm glad I bought it and now I have to get  one for the wife's car."
5,Powerful portable jumper,2021/9/23,"I've had battery issues with my vehicle for a while now. When I use this jumper, my V8 400HP engine fires right up. It's small, convenient, and tells you when you have a good connection to start the car. I love it. My only drawback is that it would be nice for it to come in a carrying case of some sort. I bought one, but I was surprised there was no carrier in this one.  Overall, I am happy with the product."
5,Simply Awesome!,2021/9/22,"I bought this due to having battery issues. Sure enough, the day after this arrived my battery died while I was at lunch. I pulled it out, followed directions - essentially put black on the black terminal and red on the red terminal and start the car when the word ""Ready"" lights up. That's it. Worked like a charm."
5,A must have,2021/6/3,"I could mention "" portability "", "" light weight"" and ""easy to use "" just like Amazon asked bit wait, there's more! Fast charging of the booster, large display and 100 different ways to charge things in a package smaller than my 3rd chin? Yup. More power than you may ever need in a boost situation? Got that too. So easy a caveman could do it? Yep, with his eyes closed. Out pizza the Hut? No, we all have our limit.  Great product."
5,This is a must have! Super high quality!,2021/7/23,"This thing is awesome! It’s way nicer than what I thought. For years I used to lug around a 40 pound battery pack that always lost charge way too fast. Now, this thing comes along and it’s like a vacation to use. The display on the front shows everything and you can’t screw it up. I’d recommend this to everyone! It’s a must have!"
5,Dependable,2021/3/10,"I love the performance of this battery. I gave it to my wife and she actually had to use it after leaving the lights on in the car. It was simple for her to use and jumped the car with no problem. I have the noco gb70 which works well but this charger has the same quality but it's smaller and it has the quick charge feature. Men, get this for the women in your life. No regrets."
5,Just what I wanted!,2021/8/14,"It does the job way better than the standard cables. I do roadside assistance and I’ve left people with their jaws dropped, people can’t believe that this thing can crank up their car instantly. And for the record. It even left a roadside ranger from State Farm chocked too. I highly recommend this machine to anyone."
5,"It charges quickly, simple to use and you can carry it in a backpack.",2021/11/4,"This device charges quickly.
You can get several starts off the same charge (It only uses about 3% per start)
It is small enough you can carry it in a Backpack.
It started my car when the battery was so low, the device couldn't recognize the battery.
Note, if you Battery is so low, that the device won't recognize there is a battery, once you have started your car, you will need to leave the device connected for a few minutes, until there is enough charge in your car's battery, that the device is no longer needed.
Do not leave it connected to the car while driving the car, it it not a battery replacement."
5,Nice unit,2022/3/11,"I haven't used it to jump start anything yet. The lights work as advertised and it charged right up to 100% from the 81% charge upon its arrival. It has a very good design and the build quality is also very good.
It doesn't come with a case but one is available for $35. I bought a $5 nylon case at WalMart that does the trick."
5,Very Efficient,2022/1/19,"Small, strong, fully charges in about an hour. I have a 2011 Yukon Denal XL. My battery was completely dead. No light no door beeping when I opened it, nuthn. It jump it straight out the box at 19%. I plugged it in the wall it hit 100% right at 1 hour. The perfect vehicle charger."
5,Works like a charm!,2022/3/27,"This little jump pack is an absolute monster. We use it for our motorhome, starts the 6.7L V10 engine with no hesitation. Would definitely recommend to almost anyone. Also the 5min charging feature is amazing. I was doubtful at first but it legitimately charges that fast. Not many normal users have much bigger engines I am thinking, so, should work great for most people. 10/10"
5,I don't typically write reviews but this item deserves 5 minutes of my time.,2021/6/14,"My 15 year old jump pack would no longer take a charge and was in the market for a new pack.  I didn't really have any expectations from the Alpha85 other than it start my car.  I am very impressed.- The charge time is quick- The design/finish of the unit is great- The on-screen menu is intuitive- The number of jumps per charge was more than sufficientI had a car with a questionable battery and bought this ""just in case"".  Minutes after receiving this, I charged it up and left my house with some new confidence that I would not be left stranded.  An hour later my car wouldn't start and I was able to put the Alpha85 to use.  This paid for itself the same day i got it.  My only regret is that I didn't know the product existed earlier."
5,I can't believe it,2022/2/6,I tried jump starting this little tiny car with my pickup I got it to turn over but that was it I let it sit for 45 minutes same results as soon as I get this thing I plug it in boom it starts and I've got top-notch jumper cables I'm amazed can I get a hallelujah
4,Does the job as long as it is not too cold.,2022/2/2,"Charged quickly and Odyssey van has started up no issues, other than alarm going off until I inserted extra key in door lock. Maybe because I had the door open while jumping?! Subsequent jumps had the door closed and no alarm.
Kind of a big negative is the jumper does not work if it is too cold. Not sure if just this model or typical for most/all jumpers. Won't be able to keep in van during winter so have to carry it with me as I exit the vehicle. that's bothersome."
4,Easy to use,2022/1/24,"Takes my car from completely dead to running immediately. I can use the ‘Force Start’ mode about 10-15 times on a full charge or the normal start function about 20-25 times on a full charge. Highly recommend.

Only fault was that it says ‘No Spark’ on the box and I definitely had it spark a time or two while connecting."
5,Impressed,2022/1/23,"I'm pleased with my purchase.  Used the Hulkman to jumpstart a battery thats been dead for months. The car battery was fairly new, approx 6 months since purchase, but the car was not in use and not started since new battery placement.  It's been very cold here, single digits.  Took 5 attempts with a 10 min safety shutoff in between after the 3rd attempt.  I suppose thats a good safety feature for those of us who like to push the limits.  After the 5 shots the charge level was only down to 58%. It didnt take long to recharge to 100% afterwards, wasnt paying attention, charge time was well within 1hr."
5,Excellent,2021/10/1,this is one of the best products I’ve bought on Amazon. Worth every penny! Easy to use and it’s so powerful and safe at the same time. I’ve charged it once (charged from 70% to 100% in 10 mins) and I’ve used it about 6-7 times and it still has 70+% charge on it. So easy to carry and the packaging was so appealing. Felt like a baby opening up my Christmas present. 10/10 recommend as this is something you will need in the future and it’s worth spending the money for such reliability!
5,Worked on my dead battery!,2021/8/24,"Bought this to revive a newer car battery in a car we don't drive very often. It has a boost feature (think of it like a heart defibrillator) it pushes charge into the battery. Mine was so dead, it took 4 boosts and the Hulkman was still over 50% charged afterwards. What's important, it got the car started which hadn't been cranked in 6 months. AND this is portable, you plug it in to charge it like your cell phone. Keep it handy to do the jobs at hand and recharge when needed. With the included attachments, it can also be used as a portable battery for any 12V device, charge your cell phone, etc. The possibilities are endless. Definitely a great tool for many uses :)"
3,Nice unit but NO BAG,2021/12/20,"I have three of these units (different sizes) and they have been great.  Stepped up for this one as we wanted a bit extra power when we are on the road RVing.  The unit is big, well made, rugged, NO BAG or case.  Seems something like this with the cost would at least come with a case."
5,Must hold two buttons together for extra boost,2022/2/9,On screen instructions are great. My battery was so dead it had me hold two buttons together to give it extra power. Once I did this little thing started my v8 with little effort. I was amazed. This thing could fit in a medium to larger size glove box.
5,Ease of use,2021/7/7,"I have a Honda generator with a 20 HP engine and is rated at 10 KW. It has been converted to propane and sits without cranking and running for several weeks at a time. Needless to say it has a poor history of keeping a battery charged. It is not in a location where a ""battery minder"" would help. My latest battery gave up the ghost so I said I would buy a Hulkman 85 jump starter and keep it charged to jump the generator. It cranked immediately as opposed to several turns using a set of jumper cables. WOW is all I can say. I was shocked as to how fast it spun the starter and cranked the generator. I give it five stars in every catagory.  Now if the durability and longivity match my initial impression, it will rank as one of my great Internet purcases of all time."
5,Jump started my Honda Odyssey,2022/2/1,I don't usually write reviews but I have told friends about this product.  Our Honda Odyssey van was dead dead for a couple of weeks on our long driveway.  Normally we would have to push the van out the long drive so we could jump it with another car.  I just had surgery so that wasn't going to happen.  I ordered this and it came the same day. We did have to look up a you tube video to really understand how to use it because our car was so dead.  But once we understood what to do it jumped the car right away.  I think it's a great product that isn't too outrageously expensive to keep in your car for emergency situations.  Highly recommend.
1,Worthless Product,2021/4/24,"I just received this product and wanted to let future customers know that it does not come with a storage case for the unit and accessories.  This will make it cumbersome to store in my vehicle.  I have decided to just store it in my garage, which makes it less available for its advertised use.  UPDATE:  Since I received this unit, I have tried to utilize it to start my car on at least 3 different occasions with no luck!  Each time I had to call AAA to come out.  I purchased this product after successfully starting my car with my neighbor's unit made by another manufacturer."
5,It works !!!,2021/6/15,"Bought one of these two weeks ago to back-up my lawn tractor battery due to long storage periods. Instant start, quick rollover, first time. Tractor battery was six years old so we installed a new one. The Hulkman now rides in my wife's Explorer in case of emergency. Well-made product, lives up to its descriptions."
5,"high quality, low price",2021/5/21,"This is a great purchase, especially for the price. A friend bought a lower power version for 3 times as much off a popular tools company. This has double the power and the quality is way better. There is a hard case that is available as a separate purchase that makes it a great package. But with or without this is a  10 ten purchase for me."
5,Just for the piece of mind,2021/3/10,"I got one for my truck and liked it so much I got 2 more for my Flex and my wife’s little convertible. Just for the piece of mind. It’s easy to use, it charges quickly and it will also charge your cell phone or tablet."
5,Well made. Highly rated,2022/3/17,"Seems good quality. Have not used yet. Easy to use and has safety features. Comes in nice packaging. It has lithium batts. Keep eye on charging. In doing research, did not notice most of not all jump starters battery life is around 5 years"
5,Life Saver,2021/10/11,My car battery was on its last leg and needed to be jumped every time I tried to start the car. THIS JUMP STARTER SAVED MY LIFE!!! I ordered it the day after I realized my car was having trouble. It came in the mail really quickly and it was really easy to use…and I’ve never jumped a car before. I used it for about a week until I was able to get a new battery installed. I keep it in the area with my spare tire in case of emergency and it doesn’t take up a lot of space at all.  I would DEFINITIVELY recommend this product… especially if you have an older car and if you are a person who travels alone or travels a lot.
5,Excellent product,2021/6/29,"I bought the to jump my dead zero-turn mower as I did not have access to plug in and old style plug-in unit.  I watched an instruction video and the Hulkman got my mower started right up.  Used it again a few days later since I did not let the mower battery charge and the Hulkman.  I guess you could say that the Hulkman ""smashed"" my problem."
5,Well built,2021/7/26,"Unit feels well built, this is definitely an upgrade from my last jumper box.  I have only used it a few times to jump my mower and to run a 12V air compressor, hopefully it is durable but we will see.  The last jump box I had was was a smaller gooloo, I had that one for about 4 years it died after I accidentally left it outside and it got rained on.  The quality seems much better on the hulkman so hopefully that speaks to the durability as well."
5,Wham Bham Charger,2021/6/7,"I love this product. I had a Jumpstart 660 which weighed about 8 pounds and it reached the end of its 36 month life.
It did a good job but was very heavy.
So I purchased this unit and have been ecstatic about it.
It works perfectly and holds a charge for 120 days and is so light.
100% recommended"
5,Surprisingly works!,2022/2/16,"Instructions easy to follow, and the prompt on the screen easy to read. The only ding is that if the same person is both hooking it up and starting the car, the short cables make it tricky to position the device in a stable place. Other than that this thing is fantastic -- it's hard to believe such a small thing can have enough juice to start a car, but it does!"
5,Skip the NocoJumper & get this,2021/10/24,This is way way better than NocoJumper.  Much more powerful.  Less expensive.  Includes a REAL charging adapter instead of Noco's mickeymouse usb cable.
5,Works well and easy to use.,2021/10/17,"Purchased this for my wife’s vehicles that was starting to show signs of battery issues. I thought the problem was corrected after cleaning the terminals, but it acted up again a couple of days ago. I wanted something small and easy to use, just in case.  She had to use it twice.  She had no problems getting it connected.  The vehicle started easily and it appears to have only used 5% per jump. New battery has been installed, but the Hulkman gives me a little peace of mind knowing she doesn’t have to be stranded should the battery fail."
5,Unbelievable,2022/2/15,"Wow, what a device. Didn't know that this existed. Found out when we needed a jump and asked a delivery guy for a jump and he took this out. I went right away a purchased one. Use once and it was a dream. We had to wait to purchase a new battery due to store delivery problems."
5,Well made.,2021/12/21,"This jump starter is very well made. Solid , durable , neat looking and well packaged. I used it a few days ago. It worked like a charm. It was 79% charged when I took it out of the box and was 100% charged after just a few minutes of charging. I really like this jump starter."
4,Cables are short,2021/5/29,I like it overall happy with my purchase however the cables seem a little to short. It came partially charged and I have used it a few times already. My father in law bought one also. I would recommend it you you will be satisfied.
5,"Extremely useful, a must have, no more need for jumper cables, enough said!!!",2022/2/10,"There is not one thing that I dislike about this very useful item, it is compact, it is lightweight, it is very simple to use, I wish it came with a storage bag that is the only thing extra I would add to this item, but that is absolutely not a dislike.  The screen is easy to see and easy to read and the warnings are perfect to alert me if I've crossed the cables or if the battery is in need of a full power jump start or just simply connect and start the battery super easy to use, I love it, will advise my friends and family to purchase one immediately!!!!"
5,Outstanding Quality,2021/9/18,"I am amazed at the quality of this product. From fit to finish it is a solid A+.

Was charged 90% upon receipt and 10 minutes of charging brought it to full power. It has held the charge for over a month. I will recharge every 6 months whether need or not.

Highly recommended."
5,"Never let me down, works great",2022/1/28,"I liked that the charge stays useful for weeks or more. It's lightweight, easy to use. My car spends a lot of time in the driveway since Covid kept me at the house so often. As a result the battery has gone dead a few times. This jump starter brought it right back."
5,What a cool little gadget,2021/8/23,"The power on this thing is amazing. My wifes corolla was sitting with a dead battery for more than 3 months. Zero charge, nothing. Forced this thing on based on the instructions right on the device and that thing cranked up in one shot. I would easily recommend this to anyone looking for a powerful little jump pack. OH also, my battery has been sitting at 77% for almost a whole 30 days now. What an amazing little device."
5,High Quality!,2021/7/23,The Hulkman is a very high quality product.  It's heavier than the cheaper competitors which tells me it's a higher quality product and battery.  You can tell instantly how nice this jumper pack is.  Highly suggest it!  The Noco is the more expensive competitor.  Buy the Hulkman and save your $$.  Incredible product!!
5,Quick jump start,2022/5/15,I love this charger! My battery kept dying. I didn't realize I needed an alternator. It charged pretty quickly. I hooked it up and waited about 3 minutes before starting car. Worked everytime. I love how it has large display. Well worth the money!
5,Dependable,2022/3/2,Kept fully charged for over a month. Had a Nissan that had sat for a couple of weeks.Low battery. Also a v6.Hooked up the Hulkman and she easily started. Unit still showed 96%. I tossed it in the passenger seat in case it happens again. So far so good!
5,BEST CHARGER EVER!!,2022/1/17,"I have an older model SUV and had recently stopped driving it for an extended period of time.  When I decided to take it out for a drive one day, it wouldn't start.  I tried using my Halo charger but no luck.  So my daughter purchased the HULKMAN Alpha85 for me as an early Xmas present.  So grateful she did!!  In less than a minute after connecting the HULKMAN to the battery, I was able to IMMEDIATELY start my SUV!  BEST XMAS GIFT I'VE EVER RECEIVED!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!  Now I carry it with me no matter which vehicle I drive!"
5,Highly Recommend For Boaters,2021/12/12,This product was kind of a odd purchase for me in the off-season. On two separate occasions this year I had a dead battery on the river. Thanks to the Hillman I was able to get back to the boat ramp. I also had to jump my riding lawnmower once. Great product. Easy to store and use.
5,Amazing!,2021/10/21,"I discovered my battery was dead approx 10pm. The fact that I had this on my porch 6 hours later is amazing. My battery was completely dead. Nothing at all when I turned the key. I hooked this up and within seconds I saw that my headlights were on. Hence, why my battery was dead. One turn of the key and the car started. No struggle or “come on, you can do it”! It started like it was never dead at all. The Hulkman had 92% remaining of 100%. Not bad for completely a dead battery. Highly recommended. I wish I took a video now. Amazon, feel free to send me products to review. I’ll be more than happy to do them."
5,Best portable jump starter on the market,2022/3/12,"This little jump starter has it all! It is very high quality and feels solid in the hand. All of the parts are premium and high quality. The starter is very user friendly and SUPER easy to use. I wish it came with a case, but the box is still small and portable and fits all of the parts nice and snug. Holds a charge very well and will start your vehicle instantly. I ended up purchasing 2 and I keep them in both of my cars. Don’t get stuck stranded without a Hulkman."
5,Does what it says (and that's good),2022/5/12,"I don't write a lot of reviews, and my last two (for other products) were negative. I figured, fair is fair, so I'm taking a moment to give this product a 5-star review. This product is great. It cost less than I expected, and was smaller than I expected, so I was skeptical. What do you know? It charges fast, holds a charge for a very long time, and fires my ATVs right up. That's exactly what I bought it for, and I'm surprised that I didn't have to pay more to get what I needed. Great product. Highly recommended."
5,"Great Purchase, no regrets.",2021/1/20,"In the past few months that I've owned it, this jump started has not only helped me but also I've been able to help other people with it. It charges fast and tells me what the problem is if the car is not able to start. Great purchase. The only pet peeve that I have with this Jump Starter is that it does not include a carrying case or bag, and thr dimensions of the battery are nowhere to be found ,I had to look through amazon and after many tries I found a case that can fit the battery and its accessories."
5,This thing is awsome! Don't hesitate,2022/1/21,"I've had this in my car for months .
Today it was 25°F and the mini-ex's battery at work was to weak to start.
This thing had 100% charge still and it jumped the mini-ex with out issue.
If you need a jump pack, this is the one for you."
5,nifty charger,2021/11/17,"I have used this nifty charger to start my car, my phone and even light up the sidewalk. Holds a charge for a long period of time and is just great to have around in case you need it."
5,Happy Customer!!,2021/8/19,Used on my first weekend of ownership. Attended scout camp with my son and I used this to recharge my phone each night and still had 65% after 4 nights and was able to jump start a large diesel pickup in the next campsite in 30 seconds with ease. Will be buying another one for my wife!
5,Hulkman Charger Is The Best!,2021/3/16,"Bought the charger for my wife’s car and was able to use the charger in the first week on another car and it worked as described and feels very sturdy and built to last.

If there is one issue it has to be that it does not come in a carrying case and as such you need to keep it in the box it comes in, which is also durable."
3,Will Not Start When Battery is Weak,2022/1/17,"If the battery is strong enough to crank the engine, then the Jump Starter will start the car; however, if the battery is so weak that it will only show lights (not dead) but not crank the engine, then the Jump Starter will not crank the engine."
1,"Worked like magic the first time, but not after that",2022/2/21,My Honda Odyssey battery was dead. I tried using jumper cables twice.  That’s when I saw the reviews for this product on Amazon and ordered the product. Fast shipment. The car started up in 2 seconds. Super impressed!  Unable to jump start the car again. Excited and disappointed what appears to be a one and done story.
1,Piece of junk,2022/3/25,This worked great for the first five or so jump starts. Then It totally quit working. Now I can't return it because the return window is closed. Just wasted $140. I should have heeded the advice from the other negative reviews. It's a shame you can't buy anything of quality anymore.
5,Un gran equipo de seguridad,2021/7/4,"Compre el cargador en conjunto con su maletín de protección, encaja perfectamente. Lo utilice una vez con el auto de un amigo, y encendió al instante, su instalación es muy sencilla y fácil de usar. Para mi es más que una herramienta es un equipo de seguridad, que lo pueden ayudar en una emergencia."
5,BAD LIL MOFO,2021/8/2,"I've had it for 4 months or so . I have a car lot, I sell cheaper cars that end up having weak or dead batteries. It works every time even when battery is completely dead with force start mode. Charges fast . Awesome product, works better than I expected it to after having a heavy snap on $300 jumper, this product is just as good."
5,Sleek big screen easy to use,2021/1/13,"This battery jumper is easy to use, the thickness od the unit is fairly slim i have it in my glove box, it saved me the 1st day i had it, my truck went dead after work and luckily i had this unit on me jumped my truck like it had a brand new battery, i had to jump it 4 times before i made it home and it went from 100% down to 80% the longevity is A+"
5,Pretty much fixes my snowmobile problem.,2022/2/19,"Bought this as a backup in case my old sled had any battery problems. It did. This product works as advertised. Cold starting this ‘98 Polaris can be frustrating. Now it isn’t. From a cold, dead battery to hitting the lake to ice fish is much easier now. Took 6% off the charger to start it and almost nothing is drained to re-start. Small, easy to use and you can’t put a price on the peace of mind this delivers. Charged it fully two weeks ago and it’s still has a lot left to use. I highly recommend this starter."
5,Amazing!!!,2022/1/22,"I have had to use this twice, once in cold weather the other on an old battery. Worked perfectly both times. I have bought 2 more for gifts. Durable, easy to operate and understand.....and, it's safe. Highly recommend it to anyone that owns a car or pickup."
5,It works!!!,2021/7/6,"Probably the first external car battery booster that works as described. My car would not turn on for over a week due to it being stationary. With the HULKMAN I was able to start the car in about 2 mins, I had to leave it on the car battery, only wasted 2% of the charge to start the car. Recommended!"
5,Gr8 product,2021/11/22,Even when it's only got 50% it will start your engine like a pro
4,Worked great for jumpstarting cars,2022/1/7,This worked great for jump starting cars. although that is not what i thought i could use it for. I thought it could hold the charge while i move my car from the car port through the garage. moving it by a whole car length. car dies after and have to restart the engine. but overall good product for what it's used for.
5,Works!! And works repeatedly between charges.,2021/3/22,"This works exactly as advertised and is very simple and easy to use. We have used this several times to jump an old car that has intermittent battery issues. The starter comes in an attractive cardboard box, but I do wish it had a case/bag to hold the charger and assorted cables. Very pleased to not have to ask for a jump thanks to this charger."
5,Great quality,2022/5/19,"I'm impressed with the quality of the product. Although I haven't actually used it yet (and I hope I never need to), I'm sure it will work as expected. Much simpler to use than a regular set of booster cables."
5,It works wonders,2022/2/17,If your looking into buying this product do !! You will not regret it one bit. It charges super fast long lasting life and a pretty good light. Turns car super fast and instructions are clear as day i love mine honestly if your going to carry anything this is it. O and space wise ahhh love it dosent take up nothing but a pinch in you car or home ! Honestly buy buy buy !
5,Impressed!,2021/5/24,"I used this for the first time a couple of weeks ago after owning it for several months.  My truck wouldn't start after getting fuel.  My expectations weren't very high as thing is pretty small.  I hooked it up, turned the key, and without any hesitation it fired right up!  My truck is a 5.7 litre V8!  Apparently it'll start up to a 8.5 litre gas and a 6.0 litre diesel!  I also like the box that it comes in, even though it is cardboard, it seems to be quality.  It makes for a nice storing container."
5,Saved the trip!,2021/5/29,"Saved the boating trip! There we were, sitting at the ramp, after four weeks of planning.  The battery was dead,  and judging from the looks from my wife - me too!But, I slapped this bad boy on the boat and it went from ""zero"" to running and charging in less than five minutes.  Definitely worth the price."
5,Trooper approved,2021/12/13,Great to jump start a vehicle on the side of the road quickly. I've helped multiple people already
3,Test it when you get it,2021/12/28,It will not jump the battery if the battery is very dead. I did not know that and didn’t use it till my return policy had expired
5,A must buy!!,2022/2/17,"This is so much better than a battery charger. It’s so convenient and easy to carry around. I love the fact you hook it up to the battery, and it let you know when it’s ready. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,No vehicle should be without this,2021/7/31,"What I like best is, if your battery dies, you don't have to get someone to give you a jump state.  The unit is much smaller and lighter than a wet of jumper cables.  And, you can't blow the battery up...the unit tells you if you have incorrectly attached the cables."
5,A powerful tool that every car driver should get.,2021/2/20,"I like this jump starter unit. Although it is a little bit too thick, it's a powerful tool that every car driver should have. The display is big and make it very easy to read. It also displays battery's power percentage of the unit, so that you know whether you need to charge it. The only thing I've noticed is that the ""one minute charging"" is not quite accurate.  It takes much longer than one minute to fully charged. However, the charging time is much shorter than most other brands. It will be much better if it comes with a carry-case. I strongly recommend this jump starter unit."
5,Dead Battery started!,2022/3/1,"I’ve never used anything like this before, it was super easy. When I connected it, I got an error, I followed the directions to push two buttons, then it was ready. I was able to start my car! 😁 thank you for an awesome product!"
4,May not start vehicle in standard mode,2022/1/15,What I like very well made big display heavy duty cables and clamps easy to use. What I did not like it would not start my Ram 1500 5.7 L engine in standard mode. I had to put it in bypass mode before it would start the engine. At least this jump starter had that feature a lot of jump starters out there do not have this feature so that is a plus.
5,Very impressed with quality,2021/4/28,"Normally don’t take the time to write product reviews but I was impressed enough by the quality of this that I wanted to leave my honest opinion. Out of the box it was larger than I expected, and has a solid weight to it, which I always think indicates quality on a product such as this. Seems like it could handle a drop with the hard rubber type material that surrounds it. All of the accessories that come with it, the jumper cables, even charger feel very well made and premium. Also it charges extremely fast. The big LED screen is an awesome feature to have and makes everything easy to use. The flashlight has multiple modes including red, it just makes a great all around emergency tool to keep in your car. I would recommend getting the case also."
3,Not Sure what's going on yet?,2022/5/24,"Finally got a chance to use it, 100% charge would not jump truck. Jumped it the old-fashioned way with another vehicle and it started right up. Not sure what is wrong but may need warranty work. Will update."
5,Excellent jump starter,2022/2/14,"I bought this to jump my V-10 F-450 bucket truck. Every Monday, we have to jump our trucks at my work, this little guy will jump 8-10 trucks without needing recharged. I highly recommend this jump pack!"
5,Jump,2021/12/14,I have not used it yet. Charges quick and I keep it in my truck. When you can't get another car for a jump this is next best thing. I mainly bought it for my boat as I have only 1 battery and like to use the stereo while parked at the sand bar.
5,This is a good jumper to have.,2021/7/27,"It's hard to review an item you may never use. But I work in a shop where I've got to use it several times. At this price point I believe this to be the best one I've owned. Maybe better than some higher priced. The cables are sturdy, not the same cheap import ones the others are using. It feels well built and charges much faster than the others. I've jumped 3 dead cars in a day and it never dropped below 75%. It wont jump a completely dead dual battery diesel, but havnt seen one that can. Even the way over priced ones on the tool truck cant. My only complaint is no storage case. Hope this helps."
5,Easy to use,2021/2/15,"Right out of the box this starter was ready to go! My Silverado pickup would not start. Parked in the garage and no way to jump start from another vehicle, I purchased the Hulkman and within seconds my truck was running. I will not leave home without it! Easy and safe to use! Highly recommended the Hulkman over all the others!"
5,It works,2022/2/18,I have used this to jump start cars and boats that were not completely dead but too weak to crank the engine. It works perfectly. Also a good flashlight and portable power bank. Probably will purchase a Hulkman Sigma 5 charger next.
5,Best for price,2022/2/27,I had one...yep had till someone decided they needed it more then me.i bought myne on sale for 100$ now the price is 129...figures.. looks like I'll have to buy another.
5,It works!,2022/1/29,Today my cars battery died completely because of my stupidity. Anyways long story short I took out my jumper and it started right up within seconds of connecting it. Chicago Snow Winters and this thing was left on 94% battery even after jumping my car. Well worth it!
5,It truly works.,2021/6/21,"I purchased this item after purchasing a used car. It truly got me out of a jam, as the battery died out. It was charge the battery back in less than 5 seconds. I highly recommend this product. Keep it in your car you never know when you will need it, don't get stranded out there."
5,Works!,2021/10/13,I really like this unit. Very intuitive to use. Needed it to start dead battery. Worked like a charm. Only thing I would have liked is that the plastic case was included in the price.  Would highly recommend. Seems well made and  is dummy proof.
5,Jumped a dead jeep,2021/5/8,I've had a jeep sitting there for over a year. This battery was dead dead.  Turned over fine. The car actually turned over better now than it did a year ago the last time I tried it.  This charged quickly. Has USB ports for emergency charging.  Sleek design. Great screen.  I wish I came with a case. But it is sold separately.
5,Very sturdy compact size!,2021/3/28,"Very easy to use, simple face screen, recharges quickly! All attachments included for jumping, cell phone charging and can recharge with cigarette lighter or wall plug!"
5,Should have bought this years ago,2022/3/12,"I had resisted getting a portable jumper because they used to be bulky and unwieldy, and complicated to use.  This product is compact and simple to use.  My wife, who tends to avoid technology when possible, learned to use it easily and feels much safer with it in the car.  Great purchase!"
5,High quality unit,2022/2/4,The unit looks like very high quality. Even package of the unit is special. Charging of the unit battery is very fast. I didn't use the unit yet but hope it is going to work properly counting on buyers' positive reviews.
5,Easy to use and handy especially in winter,2021/3/10,Great product. My car battery was completely drained as I had to park it in the NE cold for almost 4 months. This Jumpstarter helped me force start my car. I needed it one more time the next day to start my car. I now keep it fully charged in the cat just in case. Very useful and very easy to use with the LCD screen showing whether the cables are correctly connected and when to start the car. Happy with the purchase.
5,Woke up to dead battery this morning!,2022/5/2,"Quite shocked to turn the key and nothing happened this morning. So this was the 1st time I had to put the Hillman to the test.
Worked in seconds and I wasn't late for work! Damn glad I bought this."
5,Amazing Product,2022/2/19,"I needed to replace an older Cobra jumpstarter with something more portable and the HULKMAN Alpha8 fit my need perfectly. A great product at a fair price. What's not to like?

Highly recommended."
5,Does not charge came with 78% and will go down but not recharge,2021/9/8,"Replacement works good so new review

Can't get it to recharge....... months later never a rey or response.... JUNK never recharged dont wate your money"
5,Almost 5 stars,2022/3/22,This is the 4th brand of portable jump starter ive purchased in the past 6-7 years. Its also the best out of them. The only improvement i can say i wish it had is slightly longer cables. Other than that this thing is awesome.
4,"Leads are a little shorter than I like, but works fine.",2022/1/20,I like the jump starter it works fine. When a battery was completely dead I followed the directions and bypassed the auto features and it worked fine. I would've liked to see a little longer leads on this jump starter.
5,Great jumper!,2022/2/10,"I purchased this product about a month ago.  Interestingly, I had to jump a car the day I received it.  Jumping a 3.0L engine only took the battery down by 2%.  Three weeks later, we lost power due to an ice storm and had more than enough power to keep our phones and computers charged throughout.  Its small size is very convenient.  I highly recommend it."
1,Went to use first time and didn't work. Its Junk.,2022/4/17,I have a Mini Cooper that had a dead battery. Went to jump start and it didn't work. Absolute junk. I'm going to buy one of the older jump starters with a lead acid battery. They work all the time.
4,Shelf life,2021/12/28,"I was surprised that the shelf life was around 3 years. I may not even use it in that time frame.
It does give me peace of mind since I have had to be towed in or had to trolling motor back to the
Dock over the last 15 years."
3,Easily to use but no case,2021/9/14,Purchased mainly to jump my car when needed. It was super easy to jump my car. Some buttons functions are a bit less intuitive and also it did not include a cover which is a negative. Other battery that I purchased for my parents came with a nice case.
5,Buy this,2021/11/16,"This Hulkman Alpha85 Jump starter is an absolute must have. No more waiting for roadside assistance.
Hey duty construction, very durable and easy to use.
Having this in my vehicle has saved me more then once and I can't begin to tell you how many families I have helped get back on the road with my Hulkman Alpha85."
5,Works. Ease of use and portability,2021/4/7,Love this Hulk man Alpha 85 portable battery jump starter. Very easy to use. Jump started my Honda Odyssey van by myself (for the first time) in the first go. Van battery was completely dead. Followed  the instructions and it worked. It is also easy to store. Will be buying another to keep in the other car too. 😊
5,Great to have on hand in the car,2021/5/23,I have used this product several times and it seems to really be a quality unit. The battery can start a car that is completely dead which is the main use case I got it for. The cables are short and manageable too so jumping cars is super easy. Power efficiency is great and you can probably get about 6 starts per charge on an average 4 cylinder. It also has flashlight and USB charging which can bring a phone up in about an hour on fast charge. Feels super quality and I love it.
5,a little large but has never let me down yet.,2021/11/2,"this thing is a little large but very powerful, last a long time and charges very quickly. As a mechanic, this is very important and well worth the price tag. Co workers liked it so much 2 others bought one as well. Very happy.!"
5,Highly recommended,2021/4/15,This jump pack will bring any battery back from the brink of extinction but don’t expect miracles using this on a completely shot battery with dead cells at that point you just have to get a new battery other than that...every motorized vehicle owner should have this at the ready
5,Alpha85,2022/3/19,"This thing is amazing. Works everytime. Absolutely love that it is so easy to use, certainly wish the cables were long but with that being said, the quality of them are top rate."
5,Saved my bacon twice,2022/3/29,"It's like insurance - you hope you don't need it. So far I've only needed it twice but it came through both times. And as a bonus, it could be of great use during a power failure. Very pleased!"
2,Not the best for my Prius hybrid - failed to start,2022/2/27,"I bought this for my Prius but when I tried to use it, it didn't have enough power to and I had to call a tow truck that was able to restart my car on the first go. Very disappointing so you might think about another product!"
4,Error code that doesn't exist in owners manual has made this pointless.,2022/4/29,Box does has jump started my car and a lawnmower that sat for over 2 years no problem.  My issue is that there is now an error code on the screen and the owners manual does not explain what an error 0 is.  It won't work now because of this error.  I have had this maybe 3 months and have used it 3 times.(Update)Hulkman immediately reached out and sent me another one to replace the one that failed.  I have raised this to a 4 star rating due to their customer service.  I will update if the second fails or not.
5,Husband says best thing he's bought!,2022/2/3,We didn't know that this product even existed. We saw some use it to jump start an RV like ours. Crawled out from under our rock and bought 2. It worked perfectly and still left us with 90 percent power!
4,"Good capacity, annoying UX for working with a fully dead battery",2022/1/28,"The jump starter has good capacity, but when trying to jump a dead battery, you often need to let it sit on the battery for a few minutes to get some charge into it before you can start the car. This jump starter makes that process a pain. Even after overriding the behavior to charge the dead battery (press and hold the two buttons), it resets after maybe 30 seconds. That means you have to continually press the two buttons to get it to start feeding power into the dead battery again."
5,Superb piece of gear.,2022/3/19,"Used it three times now to start my truck, which has a slow electrical drain it's been hard to track down. Beyond that used it to charge cell phones and as a flash light -- great purchase all around."
5,Great product,2022/2/28,Works great. Seller went above and beyond helping with any questions we had. Would purchase again.
5,Looks Nice,2021/12/14,I haven’t use it yet I bought it for an emergency needs in case I need it. So far so good looks alright I often check if it holds the charging volts in the unit no problem at this time still 100% full charge.
5,Unsurpassed quality!,2021/3/15,"I returned a 50 dollar jump starter I bought here on Amazon because it was cheaply made and didn't work very well. I bought this hulkman for about 80 dollars and there couldn't be more on a difference! This thing is awesome! It's built well, it's solid and heavy! Very high quality battery clamps with nice copper construction. I've only had it a few weeks but can say nothing bad about it. One of the nicest products I've bought in some time. I cranked over an old motorcycle without a battery with this thing.( Probably not recommend) Look no further and just buy it now!"
5,It works well,2021/7/4,"This jump battery is amazing. For its size it can really make a engine crank. It doesn't loose muck power for each start. My tractor battery was dead. Started it 5 times after making adjustments to the tractor inv
Between. Only dropped power on battery to 87%. This thing is amazing."
5,So easy a girl can use it!!,2022/2/15,"I bought this because I have not been driving a lot due to working remotely. I was sick of always calling roadside assistance for a dead battery even though I was always starting my car. Winter is not kind to car batteries in MA. So I bought this after reading reviews. I just did my first solo jump today, and coming from someone who is SO not a car girl, this was so easy to use. I’m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it."
5,Awesome,2022/3/14,"Great portable jump starter. Also has flashlight. Hazard flasher and port to charge phone. Only uses 3% of charge when I jump start my truck. So small, fits under my seat."
5,Can jump a completely dead battery with less than 20% charge,2021/12/31,"Really like it, i used on car with completely dead battery and only 20% charge first turn fired up. Easy to carry and store under a seat for that time you really need it. Wish had a carrying case or bag though. This does have a boost feature when need to give a little extra."
5,Works instantly!,2021/6/17,I love that the Hulkman is very compact and easy to use.  I used it on my daughter's car which has been sitting in my driveway for months and it started up instantly.  Directions are right on the equipment and virtually fool proof for anyone to use.  This is a great product.
5,Life saver,2022/1/2,"This jump starter really delivered.  My battery was completely dead and I was unsure if it would work. Also I wasn't sure if I knew what I was doing but the instructions were super easy to follow and my car started and has been starting without any issues since jumping it. Buy it, you will not regret it."
5,Exceptional customer service experience,2022/4/14,Didn't work as I used it 1st time but customer service from this brand is very good. They send the replacement which works great now. Their product looks solid and long-lasting. I am hoping to buy more from this brand again. Highly recommended this product.
1,Worked for 6 months,2022/4/21,"I really liked it at first and its very easy to use. But, unfortunately it's stopped working after 6 months of use.
I cant start anything, even the battery is fully charged (100%). Emailed the manufacture but so far nothing from them. Be aware before you buy this"
5,Does what it says it delivers,2021/10/24,My brother car has been sitting around for a few years now.  The battery was totally drained sitting in the desert sun.  I hooked it up and it started the car!  I couldnt believe it but it did.  Great product so far.
5,Life Saver,2022/1/18,This unit is incredible. My car battery started draining overnight for some reason and this unit jump starts my 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid every single time I need it to. I was able to get at least 15 jump starts out of this thing before I hit 40% and charged it back up. The flashlights are super handy and the fact that it can power accessories with the 12V barrel adapter and charge your phone is just added bonus.
5,Best!,2021/3/28,"Tested this by jumping my full size bronco with a completely dead battery. Worked like a charm. Started with a 100% charge and jump my bronco, left it alone and used it again, again and again. down to a 70% charge and still kicking ass against this dead battery. Love it, and you will too!"
5,Excellent customer service,2021/11/30,"Bought in May 2021, sat in car until last week when I decided it should be recharged, plugged it in, heard a crack and it stopped recharging, Now basically a brick. From previous reviews it appears these lithium jump starters are not ready for prime time. Phone number on warranty card is inactive or dead. What good is a 24 month warranty when you cannot contact the company? Don't buy.
10 days later...Decided to email the company, they responded the next day and three days later I received a new unit. Impressive customer service."
5,Quickly recharge to use again,2021/2/16,"I transport cars for a living and this unit is much nicer than my bulky lead acid/agm counterparts, love the fact that it charges using USB C so I can quickly recharge, the other gray brand battery booster has left me without a running car many times and/or took all day to get to 75% charge..."
1,El PRODUCTO NO CARGA,2021/9/3,EL PRODUCTO NO CARGA CORRECTAMENTE. Carga 2/3% y deja de cargar se debe desconectar y conectar nuevamente para q poco a poco cargue
5,Excellent Tool,2021/11/7,"This small device is really easy to use and starts up our car easily, multiple times. It even starts a completely dead battery and has charge left to spare. It is simple, very portable and we highly recommend it."
5,Super Starter!,2021/3/12,"Charges quick.  Very heavy duty.  Started dead battery with little effort and very little draw.  Have not needed to emergency charge, but the 5 min quick charge will prove worthy first use.  Bought a second unit for my wife.  Will be a an asset to me on my long drawn mechanic jobs."
5,High Quality and Great Value,2021/6/2,"The Hulkman Alpha 85 jump starter came well packaged, 80% charged and quickly charged to 100% when I plugged it in. It is well built and high quality. I was considering a more expensive brand before purchasing this one and I’m glad I went with Hulkman."
2,Very annoyed.  I keep getting warning #4,2021/7/5,It keeps beeping showing warning #4 & won't work.. and today it got so hot It displayed warning #3 . This thing only works like two to three cranks and I get that warning 4 pop up then it doesn't do squat except beep for 10 straight minutes. Hulkman. HELP
5,Worked when I needed it,2021/8/8,"I was working and someone had a van in the parking lot that wouldn't start.  I immediately retrieved my Hulkman from my car, attached to his battery and voila!  It started on first try.  Couple was so impressed they wrote down name and were going to order one."
5,Tried; worked well,2022/1/12,"Minivan's battery was so dead even the remote key couldn't open car door. This charger started the battery in few seconds. Wish they included a carrying case with it, at least at a discounted bundle price."
5,Didn't work,2021/7/7,"The initial unit that I received didn't work properly but cussing service was simply amazing. They actually reached out to me and went above and beyond to correct the problem. The new unit that I received worked better than I expected. When I received the new unit, I immediately tried it out on an old car in the garage and this thing was amazing. Thanks Hulkman"
5,"Compact, simple, and safe - a great product!",2021/10/21,"I was skeptical at first as the first unit I ordered read 118% on charging and the display flashed.  I returned it, and ordered a replacement that arrived in less than 24 hours.  The second one worked like a charm.  I like the fact that you hook up the cables first before ever turning the unit on, a great safety feature.  I was always concerned that my long jumper cables would pop off the terminals and create fireworks.  No tension in operating this product. just superb!"
5,The Best!!,2022/1/31,Just tested out today on one of my work truck. It's Started right away!! The truck (the one that lost like a UPS truck) had a completely dead battery. Within less than half of minutes it's started right away!!! Very happy with purchase. Will buy again!!
4,Good jump starter,2021/6/11,Purchased to have a backup plan in the event my boat batteries got overly drained. Starts boat with a 5.7 engine perfectly. Has also served very well to power a spot light during night trips
4,Appears to be very well made.,2021/8/2,"Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I haven't needed to use it yet, however it appears to be very well made.  Only wish the cables to hook up to a battery were longer since I keep this on my boat and the batteries are down in the bilge."
5,A must have for automobile owners!,2021/8/2,"Excellent piece of kit! No more clunky jumper cables, no more needing to ask a stranger for help. These are easy to use, easy to store and work great. Excellent for 12vlt lawn tractors and ATVs as well. I highly recommend this handy gadget!"
5,Awesome Buy,2021/2/15,"This compact jump starter is awesome. It’s way better than the old bulky jump starter I used in the past, that only lasted about a year and even then I had to have it connected to power to keep it charged.
The hulkman, I charged one time when I first got and since then have used it it about 15 times and it still has a 55% charge on it. The lithium batteries are way better that whatever is used in the big bulky jump starters."
5,A must have,2022/5/17,"Easy to use and works great
Small, highly portable, very clear directions
I have helped several people with dead batteries since purchasing it!"
5,Worked better than expected,2021/4/14,I had my reservations about this but they all were squashed when I had to use it. I have a 2003 Corvette with intermittent electrical gremlin and this morning was that day I needed this. Hooked it up super easy and with no hesitation my car started first crank even on a dead battery.
5,It works,2022/1/22,My car battery was DEAD dead. Like dead for 3 months kind of dead. Hooked this little box up to it and it started right up! It’s a great product. It feels well made and is simple to use. It only used 4% of the charge to get my car going. Very nice product at a great price
5,Easy to use,2022/2/13,"I have AAA service, but I wanted something that I can use when I don't have the time to wait 30+ minutes for a jump, or a good Samaritan to come to my rescue. This is very easy to use and worked for what I needed. Highly recommend!"
1,This device couldn't start my Nissan Patrol dead battery ?!!,2022/5/24,"This device couldn't start my Nissan Patrol dead battery ?I followed all the written instructions strictly
at first when I connected it , the screen never displayed "" Ready "" !! there was no error message either
I pressed both buttons (power and led light simultaneously to force output. finally the screen showed ready once I tried to start the car , the Ready on display disappeared and nothing happened !!"
4,"If your battery dead, this thing will not help you.",2022/2/20,Only help if your battery not completely dead
1,SCAM!!!!!!!!,2022/5/6,This is a total scam!  Nothing but a flashlight!  Maybe it will jump start an iPhone.  It absolutely did not work when I tried to jump my jeep Cherokee.  Stick to jumper cables!
5,Nice budget friendly jump starter,2021/4/1,"I just received the item (3 days early). I opened it and was surprised by the fact that it's got a nice weight to it, giving the fact that it was less than $100. I do like the flashlight feature (low, high, strobe, S.OS., red strobe). It seems very simple to use. I will update in a few months after using it.

Update: I have jumy started vehicles about 5-6 and the charge is still at 66%."
4,This product does everything i need it to.,2022/4/21,Once i read the directions i found out this product will do everything i need it to do. i have use it on several occasion and it has done what i needed it to do.
5,This is the iPhone of jump starters!,2021/9/5,"This thing is awesome! It's packaged like an iPhone, it has all connections included and can start a truck...or your iPhone....or your 12V air pump...or your laptop. It is intuitive and as solidly built as an old HP Calculator...ok, enough with the comparisons.  I am genuinely impressed with this product."
5,I will never travel without one fully charged in my vehicle again,2021/10/17,"This things is the ""Cat's Ass"". It starts my 5.7l Hemi Ram pickup truck no problem. It's small and compact and brings a sense of calm while traveling and I travel a lot. Everyone should have one in their vehicle."
5,Every car should have one.,2021/12/30,"Assembles easy, gator clips clamp securely to battery terminals and it jump started my 1936 chevy which has not been running for two months in a cold climate. Battery did not have enough juice to turn over the motor. Hooked up the Hulkman and it cranked/started right up. Going to buy several more for my other cars and my family members."
5,Excellent!,2021/3/11,"One of my best Amazon purchases. This thing will start a completely dead car battery. As a tip, if you get an error message (some orange alarm with the number 2) when you try to jumpstart, then hold down the On and Light buttons at the same time to give an overhaul charge."
5,powerful jump starter,2022/4/20,"We have a small automotive repair shop and are always running into dead car batteries. This pack can be carried in the palm of your hand, but don't let the size fool you, we started a dead Chevy Duramax with it, although it was not cold weather. Very nice and capable unit."
5,Seems well built,2022/4/10,"Haven’t needed it yet, but I am impressed at how sturdy the clamps and wires are. Electronics on Amazon can be a good or cheaply made. This seems decently solid. Not professional, but confident it will perform when needed. -Former automotive electronics tech."
5,WOW,2021/5/20,"I would give this product 6 stars it is easy to use. It fits easily into car storage space-hold charge for over a year-eliminates danger if crossed jumper cables-is lightweight-has extra features-no car should be without one

I buy one for everyone on their birthday;they all ultimately thank me profusely

This is the state of the art in car safety"
1,Pos couldn’t jump start a lawn mower,2022/1/5,biggest pos.  Hulkman junk. Says 2000 amps yet it couldn’t start a civic let alone a truck.  Tried jumping a car. It said 100 percent. And then all of a sudden it went into lock out mode for over heating apparently.  You have to wait 10 mins to use it again.  Harbor freight one half the price and blows this one away.  Don’t waste your money.  It’s junk
5,it works every time,2021/12/9,"I like how portable, easy, and quick it is to use. My van needs work, and until I can save enough for that, I use the hulkman to start it up when I need to go someplace.

Here is an idea for those who might need one.
An item that sits on the dash, soar powered battery charger, that has a direct line to the vehicle battery, so that the charger can keep the battery charged up, without the need for extension cords and other things external to the vehicle."
5,Will buy more from Hulkman!,2021/4/12,So far I have used this on a tractor nothing too big that we have at work to jump start and that's really the intended point of why I have this in my own personal vehicle. It's good quality build good name brand and charges very quickly which I'm impressed by. Highly recommend this to anybody else if they're needing something for emergency purpose or anything else that might require such.
5,Love the New Technology,2022/1/15,"This is such an improvement over the old charger/starter that I’ve carried around for years that finally wore out and stopped working. This new one is compact, powerful, and efficient."
1,Ineffective,2022/4/8,"Completely ineffective. Attempted to jumpstart a small battery, a motorcycle, and it was unable to do so; even after multiple attempts. I don’t have confidence that if stranded, this would be able to jumpstart a car.
I don’t recommend."
5,Quality equipment,2021/7/17,"I have not had to use this yet.  It charges quickly with a powerful wall charger.  Stored it in the car trunk for three months.  Brought it out to maintain the charge, as recommended, and it was still showing 100% charged."
5,Must have,2021/12/14,"Just in case.  You have to go out prepared and this fits the bill , compact, powerful and easy-to-use, also bought the case and it fits perfect under the back seat of my '21 Tacoma."
1,The jump starter does not hold a charge.,2021/10/6,The jump starter didn’t hold a charge for even a week. I returned it just to have the same issue with the second. Still waiting on my refund two weeks later. Would not recommend this product to anyone
2,62% max charge after 2 months.,2021/7/7,"I am 60 days from purchase and it will only take a maximum charge of 62% after normal use. It ran an air compressor a couple of times and charged our phones while camping. Now, only 62% maximum charge.

Amazon has replaced the original purchase. I may have to edit the number of stars based on the performance of the replacement..."
4,Works like a charm,2021/8/2,"Works really well and is easy to use. However, I wish they had it delivered in a carry case like other manufacturers do. It comes in a cardboard box, which is sturdy but bulky and not made to move from car to car."
5,Great Emergency Tool,2022/2/2,My RV battery was totally dead. I borrowed my neighbors Hulkman and it started right up. I immediately ordered one. Totally impressed with its power & portability.
5,excellent customer service,2021/9/8,"excellent quality! Great customer service . very helpful with your needs , very fast shiping!"
5,THIS IS THE SHIZZ!  NO NEED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER!,2021/5/8,I have shopped a lot for a jumper.  I got this one and I couldn't be happier.  The one thing that could make it better is if they included a case with it.  The jumper is great!  It is easy to use and works wonderful.  It will jump your vehicle without a battery in it!  Some of the jumpers out there for sale will not jump your battery if it is more then 50% dead.  That's WACK!  You need to look no further.  Buy this jumper you will be very happy that you did!
5,This has been a lifesaver,2021/11/7,Love this thing. I have some kind of wire or something that has been draining my battery and mechanic can't seem to find where its coming from. This has worked great to get me going.
5,Didn't start my dead battery on an 8 cylinder truck.,2021/11/19,I dislike this product because it didn't start the battery in my truck that's an 8 cylinder it gave me an number 2 error code instead of starting the truck. I'm very dissatisfied with this product i purchased it was a waste of my money.
5,Stay charges for a long time and is light in weight,2022/2/26,"I bought two, one for my son"
5,Works great over and over,2022/1/11,Had a battery issue which required me jumpstart my Dodge Ram several times . The Hulkman only went down to 78% after several charges in the frigid cold. I feel so much safer and have such a comfort level knowing I can jumpstart my vehicle anytime anywhere and I can also help other stranded drivers. This is so easy to use. Love it!!
4,So easy to use,2022/3/2,Packs a punch….haven’t had it log enough to see how long the charge last…came with80% on the unit….box is nice but wished it had a carry case included.
5,Couldn’t be simpler,2021/3/19,Just bought this a month ago. I’ve already used it 3 times to jumpstart my car. Works so quickly and easily. Just connect and start the car. That’s it. Also love that I can use it to charge my phone and it even has a handy flashlight. The box it comes in works as a handy case to keep it together with all the connections and cables it comes with. I’m very happy with it.
5,This thing is great,2021/6/3,"Seems very well made.  Super simple to operate.  The only slight ding I can offer is there is nothing in the documentation about charging the battery.  Documentation issue aside, I would absolutely recommend this thing."
5,Worked great,2022/2/7,Simple to use. Clear instructions.  Arrived at 80% charged and took only a few minutes to charge to 100%.  It worked like a charm the first time I used it. My car started right up and I drove the car to the repair shop to have the battery checked.  This is so much better than jumping the dead battery from another car.  It's also a great reserve battery to charge devices in case of a power failure.
5,"Own a Boat, You Need This!",2022/2/11,"If you own a boat, you need this product!
You can store for up to 18 months and it will crank many times when stuck on the water!
Capt Guide Gear Approved!"
5,this product has better specs than a similar product that is twice as much,2021/8/19,there's nothing I don't like about this product I use it all the time as a portable battery charger for my phone my vape and it's a killer jump box will start alot of different size batteries no problem also offers great safety features like if you accidentally hook the cables up wrong it won't fry your battery
1,Won't charge past 86%,2021/12/10,Had the charger about little over a year and won't charge past 86%
5,Great device!,2022/5/30,Very easy to use… able to jump start car with a very dead battery… and I’m not too mechanical. Great to have around for emergencies.
5,Amazing jump starter,2021/1/31,"Amazing build quality and price. This thing is a beast, I previously bought a different jump starter for almost the same price and it didn’t come close to this one. I absolutely love the screen design and features. The flashlight is insanely bright, it has a water and weather proof design, it’s easy to use and fully charging it takes under 10 minutes. I want to go wear a cape and jumpstart peoples cars now."
5,Doing great so far,2021/11/8,just stick the clamps on and it goes. No wiggling or moving them around to get contact. It also charges fast and doesn’t use much battery to jump a vehicle. I’ve only used it about a dozen times but very pleased with it so far.
5,So far so hood,2022/1/26,"Used the product on a completely dead battery, I read the reviews on pushing the second button when battery is totally dead worked like a charm only used 2% power. Highly recommend."
5,Works great! Easy to Use!,2020/12/9,"I watched a few reviews on Youtube and it peaked my interest. I missed out on the early bird pricing on Kickstarter/Indiegogo so I waited lol. Good to see this available on Amazon for $99! I was planning to leave this in my car for upcoming off-road adventures. It's a great ""just in case"" tool in my opinion.  Soooo for my actual review......first the negatives....1. I wish this came with some sort of case. 2. I wish a case was available for purchase. Now for the positives.....very easy to use, basically plug and play. You don't have to know anything about cars to use this device.  I've already used it to start my neighbors car and it worked perfectly!"
4,charged phone as a test not impressed,2021/1/20,"I charged the product to 100% I then tried to charge my phone which was at 75%. Phone charged to 100% but the Hulkman's charge went way down. Not sure if this would have the capacity to actually start a vehicle, but I haven't tried. I figured I'd start with something small before I trusted this to jump a battery."
1,"Junk , Junk",2021/7/21,Piece of junk - one jump makes this nearly useless. Don't waste your money
5,Have needed it twice in one week.,2022/1/26,This is a must for your car repair kit.  I have used it twice in one week.  Charges fast and is a breeze to use to jump a battery on a car.  Would recommend.
5,Every car owner should own,2022/4/23,This is something every car owner should have. Anyone who has more than one driver in a house or kids they're driving they should have for every single are they on.
5,Freaking Amazing!,2022/4/5,OMG! 100% dead battery (code 2) started instantly. Replaced old Stanley jump pack from Walmart. One of the single best purchases I've ever made.
5,Does the Job,2022/1/28,"This jumper starter does the job even with a low battery. The standby time is amazing. Had this thing in my trunk for months, took it out and use it with no problem. The battery life is amazing."
5,You will never be stranded with a dead battery again!!,2021/11/25,"I bought this battery booster when I needed to replace the battery in my 2017 BMW X1.
So glad I did!!!

The unit came pre charged at 82%. I plugged in the wall charger and had 100% charge within 10 minutes.

Hooked the cables to my battery, car started up immediately.

The unit even worked at 30% charge.

The compact size is perfect for cars, trucks, SUV, and even motorcycles with a saddle bags."
5,Don't regret my purchase,2021/7/9,"Such an amazing device, it was able to cold start a diesel engine without any problem at all. It came in a great presentation box, with a good amount of accessories. Only thing I would say is that it has a little design flaw (which I don't mind and because I keep the clamps plugged doesn't bother me) that is that the cover tabs, are too short and soft, so they are very likely to break on the first pull. Besides that, great battery pack!"
5,My favorite product I ever bought on Amazon,2021/11/16,Hands down the best jump starter I ever bought. I never write reviews but I had to on this amazing jump starter. If you purchase this you will not be disappointed.
5,Great product for my small car,2022/4/8,"I have an old MG that has a battery that  gets finicky when not driven for a few days.  Bought this to eliminate the need for using my car constantly across the back yard.  Super easy, great product build, nice packaging."
5,A Wise Choice,2021/4/29,"This is exactly what I was looking for,  quality,  performance,  price,  warranty & even LOOKS 😁.  I'm buying one or two more. I have a 1990 Silverado with a 5 7L engine with a bad battery that I use around the house that has to be jumped off every time I use it. This Hulknan Alpha 85 has jumped it approximately 12 times and still has 67% left on it, and still cranking it as if i have a brand new battery in the truck. Can't go wrong with this one.  oh, the LED Disply is AWESONE!! I have three different jump boxes and this is my favorite!"
3,Nice features but unfortunately it didn’t work for me.,2021/7/6,"Charged it fully before I attempted to use it, then Tried it twice on two different cars, and unfortunately it would not work. As a matter of fact, it didn’t even attempt to work. I really wanted it to workout because it has other nice features that I really liked."
5,Hulkman Alpha 85,2022/3/8,This is the IPhone of portable jumpers.  Solid build excellent feel and features.  I have one for every car I own.  Better than anything else out there.
5,Worth the money,2022/1/27,"Seemed expensive but really does outperform any other similar product our household has owned (and there have been a few)
Charges very quickly
Holds charge for months
Strong enough to recharge laptops via USB-C
Great interface shows charge rate and green ""ready to jump"" makes jumping a vehicle pretty much idiotproof
Would recommend!"
5,You won’t regret this purchase,2021/8/7,Best purchase I’ve ever made. Works better than expected. I jumped started my 15kw generator. And my Ford Explorer. Worked like a charm. After both it was still at 88% battery life. Best thing to have around. I would pay more for it. Worth every penny. Love it. Love it. Love it.
5,Exactly as advertised,2021/6/15,I used this booster  for the first time and jumped 5 batteries and boosted 5 different batteries.  I still had over 50%.  This thing is a beast.  Definitely would buy again and recommending to all i know.
5,Great product,2022/1/15,"This is really helpful, I had multiple battery failure in last week due to car electric issues, battery jump starter works everytime. This is great product."
5,So far so good.,2022/2/28,When I received it it was 85% charged and too only 10 min to fully charge. It started my straight 6 up WTH 1 crank and the %went down to 97%.
5,Price,2021/11/26,"The jump box working great no issue starting cars and bmw diesel engine, charge to fast, only recomended if the car don’t start at first attempt disconnet the jump box and wait one minute to prevent overheating in the jumpbox and enter in safe mode for 10 minutes"
5,So much power in a small package,2021/9/23,"I loved the portability of it. It turned my 5.7 Chevy engine with power to last.
Its small enuf to take with me on my Harley when I go on long rides. I can recharge our batteries in emergencies, our cellphones or basically anything needing power."
5,Great power to start vehicle easily.,2022/1/10,I really like the unit and ease of use and it is very powerful.  I think it is a little big and requires more room to store it in the vehicle but that is the tradeoff for a more powerful unit.  Would definitely recommend to a friend!!
5,Easy and pwerful jumpstarter,2020/12/22,"Bought this Jump starter for my father inlaw. He has a mini ""junk yard"" at his property and he likes to work on cars.  Some of them have iffy batteries in them and thissweet device is easy for him to use since it does not have any extra settings like the old jump boxes do. He has jumped a few cars and he has thanked me for this gift many times now. Last time I was at his house, he jumped a 98 F150 and his John Deere tractor> he likes showing it off to his friends and he brags about how nic and easy it is..  All in all, a great purchase and gift"
4,Great size. Very useful so far,2021/3/24,We actually have this battery for use to recharge a remote in our house. It is really nice that it does not continually output power. It fills the remote and then rests itself. It is very small for having the ability to start a car.
4,"Great bundle, wish it had a carrying case.",2021/2/19,"Jump starter charged up fast using the INCLUDED fast charger!  I would have liked to see the package come with a carrying case. However, I feel that it was a good value when you take in account all of the included accessories."
2,Decent jump pack.,2021/1/1,Easy to use. Drops down charge very quickly if used multiple times. Overheats. Can't charge if too cold or hot. Errors out very quickly.
1,Didn't work,2022/2/12,Didn't work. Returned for refund.
5,"Sturdy, well made and charges in a jiffy!",2021/6/28,"Sturdy like a rock. Has quick charge chip, which helps charge up the jump starter faster. It’s also very well made. Well, I’d call it the ‘Apple’ of jump starters. Detail oriented design and premium quality of materials."
5,Tesla jump start,2022/1/15,"With same day delivery, I was able to use the Hulkman to open the front trunk on my Tesla model 3 when the 12v battery died. Once inside the trunk, I used the Hulkman to reboot the car’s computer and get the car back on the road. Thank you Hulkman."
5,Hulkman Alpha85 is a miracle saver.,2022/4/23,"Today, I helped a stranger whose pickup truck ran out of battery in a gasoline station.  The attendants tried to use a big car battery to jump start but failed. I offered to help. This was the first time ever I used my Hulkman85. And his truck turn to life,  in just one attempt.  He was very grateful.  I told him to take a photo of the hulkman and buy one for himself.  Location: Philippines."
5,Portable,2021/12/23,Very good product
5,Excellent to have!,2021/8/24,This is one of those things that once you own you can’t imagine living without. No ware and tear on your battery to jump another vehicle. Awesome functionality and look. It is however not obvious on how it functions with the controls. Easy once you figure it out though.
1,Mine has never worked,2022/4/30,"I had bought this hoping it was going to come in handy when I needed it. One of our vehicles would not start and it was game time, o Lord, how disappointed. The jump starter was fully charged, at least it was showing me that. I am not sure what is the issue but after trying numerous times, we reverted to the old cable jumpstart and connected out second vehicle and we were successful. Either I was sold a bad unit or this thing do not work!"
4,"good product, but has no carrying case",2022/3/5,"This product is fine except there is now storage/carrying case.  My fault for not reading the entire description I guess.  I had another product just like this but I gave it to my son, so I thought I would upgrade to a new one.  My old one had a great little carrying cast that held all off the accessories.  I guess I will just have to store this one in the box it came in."
5,Easy to use,2021/3/22,Charged fully before use.  Connected to car battery and jumped start immediately.  Very easy to use and handy to have.  Worth every penny.Previously purchased one from Costco that ended up returning because it didn’t work.
5,Ever so happy with this buy!!!,2021/3/23, All I can say is winner winner chicken dinner but has been so much help for the cold mornings in my Ford ranger takes less then 6 to 8% to usually jump.
5,Worked in -23°,2022/1/9,"I have never had any luck with portable jump starters but bought this Hulkman 8.5 as a necessary item for up north. My 5.7L Ram sat for 3 days in -23F weather, then would not start. No cranking or clicking. Just frozen. The Hulkman did it though!  Attached it, waited for 30 seconds and the Ram started right up. Also used it on the UTV in -11F. Great product. Would highly recommend. No more waiting for someone else to jump start vehicles."
5,As Advertised,2021/3/21,"This large capacity quick charging battery with easy to read battery charge started up my silverado in no time! I have another battery jump starter that required me to push a button, it would then beep, then I'd have to get in the truck and try crank it. If it didn't take I'd have to repeat the process all over again... With this unit I just have to attach the connectors and that's it, i then just get in the truck and turn the key! Much less hassle, would definitely recommend 👌"
5,BEST JUMPSTART FOR THE MONEY,2022/1/8,DONT LISTEN TO THESE FOOLS THAT ONLY GAVE 1 STAR THIS JUMPSTART IS BADASS I HAD ORDERED 3 AND NO PROBLEMS AT ALL STARTED MY HUMMER RIGHT UP WITH A DEAD BATTERY SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PURCHASE THIS ONE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
2,"If you need a jump, this isn’t it.",2021/7/27,"Nice set up, easy to understand and use. However, very disappointed it would fail to work on a 92 Mustang 5.0. It literally did nothing, except make the clicks of my dead battery stop."
5,For the very 1st time.....,2022/5/18,"I've been shopping the world for a very long time, for a vast many products and never have i been so impressed by the product, the seller and the delivery. The HULKMAN Alpha 85 Battery Jump Starter has paid for itself already. After other terrible past chargers Its truly the best i've experienced. In power and ease of use. I ordered this at roughly 7:30 am for a 10am-3pm delivery and it arrived at 10:15am.

Bravo Amazonians"
5,Safe,2021/12/5,I have not needed to use it yet. My husband wanted me to have one to keep me safe so I don’t have to ask someone to jump my car. I will update when I use.
5,Love it.,2021/10/3,I really like this device. I have used it at least 6 times already. Works like a charm. I dont have to worry about jumper cables or asking someone to please give me a jump. It only uses 2% power to jump my totally dead battery in a  3.5l van. I can do it all safely by myself.
5,Easy to use,2021/1/25,Out of the box the unit is very easy to use and seems built nice. I didn’t have to use to jump a car but I use it to charge multiple different things. The size of the thing is amazing. I hope it works when and if the battery goes bad.
5,"Instructions could be a lot better, but I was able to figure out everything",2022/4/19,"I've used this product 4 times already, and it worked flawlessly due to the battery going dead on my 2019 Toyota Tacoma"
5,Works better than expected.,2022/1/6,"Using this is very easy. Simply connect it then watch the display.
After connecting it to the battery the display turns on indicating its charge level and whether or not it's ready to jump.

I've used it to jump 4, 6, & 8 cylinder cars & truck.
Charges quickly with a 36w charger & USB C cable."
5,Start me up,2021/8/23,Needed to start my second car with a dead but good battery. Starter the car. Drove it on the freeway for about 15 min. Put the unit on charge and got the battery back up over 75%. Now I start the car once a week on its own. This saved me a lot.
5,It works,2022/3/20,"Yes it will jump a 6.7 ford.
Yes it charges phones an has a cool flashlight.
Read instructions and you can't go wrong. A++"
1,Didn't work on a 2003 PT Cruiser,2021/12/19,"It did not work for my 2003 PT Cruiser. I got the unit the same day the car stopped cranking. 100% charge, it did show ready once connected but no luck. Using another car's battery I was up and running in a minute"
5,Everybody needs at least one of these!,2022/2/13,"After experiencing a battery issue with the boat, I bought this unit. Within a week I needed to put it to work on another battery problem. I now own three of these jump starters, kept in the cars & boats. Compact and easy to use. Everyone should have one of these in their vehicle."
5,Plenty of power & Easy to use,2021/3/14,"Really like this product. It was extremely easy to use. Bulky and heavy compared to my brothers, but probably because of the battery size and power. It delivered plenty of cranking power on 1st use. As a matter of fact, it cranked my tractor mower faster than my big electrical charger/jumper. That was the main reason I purchased, cause tractor doesn't charge battery. Highly recommend this product."
5,Strong,2021/8/21,"Out of the box, it had 65%. No charging went straight to jump a 4cyl care with no issues. It went down only 2%. Without charging it back up, I jumped my diesel truck. It went down 4%. Not bad. It had plenty of juice."
5,Works great !,2021/12/7,"Finally got to use it, 12/6/21 purchased last summer,  used on a completely dead battery it started the car within 2 revelations of the engine,  quite expressed with the power pack."
5,Better than any jumper cable,2022/2/9,Nice heavy unit feels like quality. Used once already still 95% of the hulk man battery left. Easy and powerful jump of Ram 5.7 hemi in the cold
3,Cables are REALLY short.,2021/7/2,The cables on this thing are REALLY short.  I can't use it safely.  I'm afraid of when I start the engine it falling & getting/being near moving parts.  If the cables were longer I would give 5 stars.
5,Big ol’ Battery,2021/3/20,"Haven’t had to use it yet, but it’s a honking battery that comes with all of the cables that you could possibly need. It charged up very fast. Only wish it had a case or bag to store it in, for now I’ll use the box it came in."
5,It WORKS!,2022/3/8,"I bought one for each car.  I was in the school parking lot today when a grandmother realized her battery was dead.  I grabbed the hulkman, attached the proper clamps to the battery terminals.  It immediately indicated “ready,” so she turned the key and presto, the car started!  So easy, so safe, and so many people in that parking lot buying a Hulkman today!"
4,Got out charged it tried starting  lawnmower  didn't do anything  (junk),2022/4/6,Followed directions tried on lawnmower didn't do anything 1st battery was low but this thing dint make any difference
5,Haven’t used yet but . . .,2021/7/3,"I bought this for emergency purposes so have not used it yet. That said, the product is packaged extremely well and the instructions are very, very clear. It appears well made and the clips are, again, well made. I expect the starter to work as described by the mfg."
5,Buy it!,2021/4/10,So much easier than jumper cables. Jumped a F-350 without using more than 2% of its charge.
5,Easy to use. Charges fast!!,2021/3/11,Have owned 3 for about a year now and definitely worth it! Good enough for small-medium size vehicles and maybe some suvs. They all still work and even use them to charge my phones and tablets since it provides very fast charge.
5,"Practical, the best purchase you can make",2022/4/26,"I bought it for an emergency because I really knew that I needed to change the battery of my car but it has been the best purchase I have made when I used it I only connected it to the battery and without much effort it started, now my brother-in-law has also had problems and using and I would really recommend this product it is the best purchase you can make it is very practical and useful"
5,Works and looks good!,2021/5/26,"I honestly liked it, I read some bad reviews and was nervous about it working. But yeah it looks awesome and started my car right up first try (2015 Dodge Charger 5.7L Hemi). I would buy again and recommend to friends."
5,Great Power Sources,2021/12/4,Bought as a bqxk up for my motoecycle ... charged and left it on the motkrcyxle.  A neighbor needed a jumo and askes if I had jumper cables - took it out and it jumoed his truck with no problem - only lost 5% of the charge - awesome
5,GREAT!!!,2022/3/23,I've already had to use this jump starter and I'm very pleased with it...easy to charge and use...would definitely recommend...
5,Great charger!!,2021/3/18,"I LOVE it!!! It has a nice rugged feel it solid built, wife battery was going dead for a few nights and it was starting it like it had a good battery, ordering a new one wife took mines!! 🤣 Oh well great charger!!!"
5,Worked 3 times,2021/11/9,"Used it 2 or 3 times and now only gives an error message when trying to jump start my vehicle.
Update: Emailed tech support and got a response immediately. We did some trouble shooting and resolved the issue. They have a great team and great product 👍"
5,LIFE SAVER!,2021/1/14,This product has saved my life! Tested this bad boy out during a snow storm. My company vehicle was completely dead and what a better way to test my new hulkman jumpstarter. Very easily to use! Quick charge came in handy and the built in LED lights made it easy to see my battery easily. 100% this is hands down one of the best investments I ever made. I highly recommend!
3,Had to use a different battery charger.,2022/3/2,"Attempted several try’s on my completely dead battery even using the force start and nothing.
Very frustrating and disappointed especially since it’s supposed to be so simple and be a powerful dynamo.
I ended up using a friends jump starter."
1,Dont waste your money,2021/11/10,This product does not work at all!  Tried it on our garden tractor and no go.  Do not recommend!  Can't depend on it!  High priced junk.  Return it!
5,Used it 4 times in one day,2021/10/31,Bought a used 2017 F-150 5.0l last year that still had the OEM battery installed. Wasn’t sure how much longer it would last so I bought this guy as insurance. Thank you Hulkman!  Leaving for work yesterday the battery finally went dead. Hulkman got me started immediately and I was able to use it three more times until I could get to the auto parts store for a battery replacement. I was skeptical seeing how small it was but man it was a savior when I needed it.
5,Versatile product with a neat carry case,2021/10/10,Works really well and both lights are very useful. First thing I used was the 12volt adapter for my tire inflator .. which was seamless.. will update once I've had a chance to use on a car
5,Cool beans,2022/1/28,It came well packaged and it look really nice I didn’t use it yet . But it was easy to set up and put together Happy with it .. yes indeed !!!!
5,Great product,2021/5/3,Great product. I used it this weekend. It was  so simple even a millennial could use it if only they owned a car. Great packaging. One of the best purchases I’ve had recently. I highly recommend it.
5,Best Power Jump unit I’ve ever used!,2022/1/7,"This thing is amazing! Can jump a Range Rover Supercharged engine MANY times.  After 3 uses to start a dying battery, the jump box was only down to 91%!  So worth the money!  And talk about charging fast, this unit will charge from 2% to 100% in 1hr"
5,Bingo. I love it .,2021/2/22,"I bought this in February but just today needed it. Accidently,  I had left a switch on in a spare van for 3 days. I hooked it up but not enough juice for anything and some warning icons on the display. I push both the Power Button, Click, all was ok. I got in and started but only ran a few seconds and died ? So I did it again. Bingo all was well.  Charger showed 85%. I'm not sure why it cut off after a few seconds ?  But I'm well satisfied."
5,Well built marine battery charger,2021/6/1,The only thing missing is a case.  The unit is very sturdy.  Sure beats carrying a car or truck battery to the boat.  Already had the opportunity to use it and started the old battery right away.
5,Great buy on this car starter,2021/6/24,Excellent buy for the price. Works flawlessly. I was surprised when I hooked it up to my dead truck battery and it started right up. Easy to store. Portable. Highly Recommend.
5,Bought as a Replacement!,2021/12/8,"Bought this to replace my worn-out jump-starter, for when my car battery dies!
(Haven't had a use for it, yet! Let's hope that I never need to use it!)"
5,Reliable,2021/3/11,In my opinion the hulkman is a lifesaver!  I’ve used 3 times since I’ve bought.  It’s nice not having to rely on another car when your car battery is dead. I ended up buying one for my wife’s car also.
5,I have confidence I can drive my tired old Subaru without getting stranded…again,2021/5/17,"Impressive device. Really thoughtfully designed.

Pros: has force mode to jump completely dead battery. Worked perfectly on a flatlined battery in a Subaru. Everything fits perfectly in the optional storage bag.

Cons: instructions on backside are in a small font I with a silver on black color that is hard to read for non-youthful eyes. Just take a picture of it with your phone so you can zoom in and read everything."
5,This thing is amazing!!! Saved my butt plenty of times.,2021/9/13,I like that it's so small an fits in my arm rest. I drained my battery one night camping an this thing started my car faster an was way easier than having 6foot cables an needed to find another Good soul to stop an help you. So easy! You clamp wait till it says ready! Which does not take long at all an start your vehicle. Even says when your running low an need to charge an that also doesn't take long at all. I'm waiting to help someone in need just so I can use this bad boy!!
5,Worked perfectly,2022/1/9,"The battery stays charged without use. We’ve started cars, trucks and a motorcycle. It’s worked as it should every time. Thumbs up!"
1,Doesn’t charge,2021/8/23,Used product one time and does not charge. I’m out of refund range. I would like replacement to give it another try.
5,"Don't look anywhere else, this item works perfectly!",2021/7/19,Don't look anywhere else! I have jumped vehicles 10 times now and 5 out of the 10 the battery was completely dead. Just remember when the battery is completely dead hit the two button simultaneously. It needs that extra boost. It also charges in less than 5 minutes. It is extremely simple to use. The clamps and everything are high-end.
5,Works great,2022/1/14,This was very easy to use and got my car started right away. Very easy and convenient and I didn’t have to wait for roadside assistance!
5,Handy and dandy.,2021/8/2,Thank you. Empowers u so u don't feel like u have rely on others. Thanks 😂 I have a second car.. I don't always start..so busy and when I go to start it..I needed this.
5,Love this thing!,2021/12/4,I've had my Hulkman 8.5 for exactly two months and the charge has remained at 100%. I finally got a chance to use it today. My work truck died so I ran out to my car to get the Hulkman. Cummins 8.9L started instantly. The charge only went down to 90%.
5,It WORKED!,2022/2/9,"Just talked my wife through using the battery. She's, well, not technical. This device works as advertised and is simple enough to use that any non-technical person can do it. Money well spent!"
5,Quicker to buy than waiting for AAA,2021/10/18,"Quicker to buy with prime and receive, and hook up to jump car than waiting for AAA to arrive. Worked flawlessly, easy to use. Portable. There’s a case you can buy too that fits it nicely. Definitely something everyone should have as one of those “better to have and not need than need and not have” items. Because when you need it and don’t have one… no fun. Nice display of battery power. With flashlight to see battery connectors in the dark."
5,Best tool in my truck!!,2022/1/7,Bought this product due to having battery issues. Best product I ever purchased. I also purchased a carrying case with it so I can put it in floor of my truck or in the back. It is amazing the power this lil battery pack has. You won’t go wrong by buying this
5,Worth every penny!,2022/4/12,This worked great to start my wife's totally dead prius. Much easier than jumper cables to use and to store.
5,HULKMAN,2020/12/27,"I really like this Hulkman battery booster so far, it's very easy to use and offers a lot of uses.  Not only can it jump start your car, but you can also charge several devices like your cellphone and other electronics."
5,Gets anything started,2021/10/1,"I bought this as a ""just in case."" Since then, I have used it quite successfully on two cars. I will never take an out-of-town trip without it."
5,Fastest jump start I have ever had.,2021/3/17,"Worked great the very 1st times I used it. I started 2 motors with it, and it cranked over really fast.  I was using a big truck battery to jump motors. This is much faster and lighter, Indiana flashlight with you when your hooking up the clamps."
5,Really works,2022/2/25,"I used this product to jump a car it used about 8% of its charge. So, you can jump a car several times on one charge."
5,Works as it should,2022/2/5,"Bought one of these after running down a battery in my truck while waiting to get seated at a restaurant.
Luckily there was tow truck in the same lot waiting to be seated, and they used one to jump start my older tahoe. Ordered on the nest day. It holds a charge for a long time. My old jump started kept going dead in a few weeks. I recommend this product"
5,Wonderful must have,2021/10/31,"I was calling Auto service often for jumps on Dodge Charger. Once connected easily,
my car engine turned over right away.
3.6 liter engine was easy to start."
3,Has a mind of its own,2021/5/13,"This device looks well designed, has nice branding and packaging, and is aesthetically on point. However, it has a feature that is not desirable. If you try 3x to get the engine to turn over, and are not successful, the device locks the ability to charge for 10 minutes. This is a well intentioned feature, but let me make these decisions for myself. I didn’t pay to have a device make decisions. I paid for a charging unit.

I’d advise against this purchase."
5,Love it!,2021/5/29,It showed up charged to 80%. I plugged it in and charged it up to 100%. I keep it in my trunk mainly as a backup. The other day my mother in law had a dead battery. This thing jumped it no problem. And then back in the trunk. It’s been about two months and it’s currently at 82%. And used it once.
5,Just about perfect,2021/9/17,This is an excellent jump starter.  I can't believe how well it maintains a charge.  Better than anything I have ever owned and used in the past.
5,"Solid built, Fast to charge up, works awesome",2021/5/26,"I have tried several and this is by far the best I have experienced.  This bad boy has everything you need except the carrying case.  charges from o% to 100% in about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Battery connector/claws are solid - not cheap flimsy. Use it to charge your devices on a road trip or any sort of travel.  due to its size, I am not certain that the airlines would allow it in your carry on bag <?>"
5,Compact and reliable.,2022/2/10,This is a great buy. My car was having electric issues and something was draining the battery. I purchased the Hulkman Alpha85 jump starter. It was as easy as 1-2-3. My car started right away when I would use the Hulkman Alpha85. It will not disappoint! 5 stars!
5,BUY It!!!,2022/3/20,This is everything they say it is! Easy to use…sleek….modern. Everyone should own one for each car. My 2017 Lexus battery has zero charge/batter completely dead. I followed the easy instructions and car start right up.  I almost never write reviews. Thank you to those who did. I’m ordering for all my family members. Money well spent.
5,This thing works,2021/9/14,"This thing is a tank and works like a gem.  Very high quality, very durable(it seems) and well made.  This basically replaced my jumper cables and a neighbor.  From 100% it goes to 91% after one use.  It holds battery life well.  After one month in the trunk(hot weather), battery had drained only 2%."
5,Excellent durable piece of equipment,2022/2/28,Very high quality piece of kit. Durable. Massive capacity. Jumps reliably. Now a essential part of my toolset. Also can charge phones or be connected to an inverter via a cigarette lighter port to power full power plugs.
2,Did not start dead battery,2021/12/21,It had a full charge and was unable to start my car's 3.5L V6 engine. Had to jump start the old fashion way with another car.
5,Good product and would buy again.,2022/1/21,Definitely a product that you need as a backup.  Boat motor battery died and jump started it 8x that day while fishing.
5,Worked perfectly. Great product,2021/4/20,Used to start a Freightliner truck with 2 batteries. Started quicker than jumper cables to a running car. Good product.
5,Worth every penny.,2021/6/24,"I was skeptical about this when I ordered it but that went away quickly after I had to use it two days after I received it,  I hooked it to a completely dead battery and it started on the first try. I would highly recommend this!"
5,Super powerful,2022/1/6,"Had a couple of vehicles with dead batteries and was able to jump both with over 85% reserve left.
Must have investment. Say goodbye to jumper cables."
5,Great!,2021/7/14,"Haven’t had a chance to use it, but, the packaging, design, material quality shows the engineering behind the product. So that’s why I decided to give it five star."
5,Small and mighty,2022/2/3,They are small but they are mighty. Wouldn’t recommend to do it often but you can jump a semi tractor with it. Love it
5,This Works!,2022/2/20,"This product works. 26 degrees in the middle of a February night and a dead battery that has been drained to start a cold start engine. Connected the clamps, started on first attempt. Worth every penny and more.
Buying two more for my wife's and son's car."
5,A Must Have for Car Safety,2021/1/14,"I bought this just in time. Moved to New England from Arizona just in time for a good snow. I had not driven my truck for a few months and it wouldn’t start, so I got to use this immediately! Started my truck up immediately in blistering cold weather. I need to purchase a second one for my Van Life van I just purchased as I plan to have one of these in each of my vehicle. Super simple to use and something that will save you much time and effort when you are jammed up with a dead battery."
5,Super High Quality and Craftsmanship,2021/5/2,Thought about taking a star off because they say the life expectancy is only 3 years. But based on the exceptional design and build quality I'm sure they did the best anyone could.
5,This is the one to buy.,2021/5/28,Very impressed with this product. This is a high-quality well made piece of equipment. Extraordinary value for the money. Arrived at 77% took approximately 5 minutes to fully charge. By far one of the best products I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Awesome!,2021/12/18,"This is a great product! It came 85% charged, we used it right away with no problems at all. It’s very easy to use and works so much faster than jumping a battery with another car! Highly recommend!!"
5,Awesome device!,2021/11/15,"Super easy to use, small, powerful. Safety mechanism is nice, but also able to be bypassed in case of a completely flat battery."
5,Must have for each car.,2021/11/11,"I bought one for each auto a day after our Pilot's battery died, and I we had to wait over an hour for a roadside assistance. The day after it arrived, I used it to jump a Ford Expedition. It was easy, and only used 3 percent of the battery. Every car should have one."
5,Saves us a tiw,2021/12/29,Wow! This is easy to use and works well. We had to jump the car 8 times to get to the mechanics and it was still at 86%.
5,User-friendly and robust jump starter. As advertised,2021/3/13,"This starter is powerful, easy to use, and easy to store because of its compact size. I used it to start my 2005 Toyota Camry and it took all of 1 try and my car had been running ever since."
5,Powerful and Simple,2021/12/25,I've used several jump boxes in the past.  This is by far the best.  No problem jumping a ram diesel.  Highly recommended.
4,Very nice but 1 flaw,2021/4/25,"Works well, solid heavy and quality unit. My only complaint is that if your car is completely dead with no juice whatsoever in the battery this unit will not recognize the battery at all."
5,It’s electric!,2021/3/12,"We have not had to use it yet, but we liked the how long the battery maintained its charge.  It is compact which is nice because it fits right inside the glove box. Compared many brands before deciding on this one."
5,Worked 4.0!,2021/7/16,Started car 3 times straight from the box.  Still over 60 % charge.  Little big and heavier than I would like but worked perfectly.  No carrying case included which is disappointing.
5,Powerful and compact,2021/6/7,I like the compact size. Takes no time flat to charge with the included wall plug. Very strong and charges a car battery in little time. A coworker left his lights on and we used it on his battery. Took less that 3 minutes to start his car.
5,Impressive,2021/5/2,Worked exactly as advertised the charging was extremely fast and I was able to charge it to 100 % from 85% in no time. I boosted off my first vehicle chevy tahoe 5.8l and it boosted in 10 sec. I have never boosted a dead battery instantly like this in all my years smh. It only used like 2% too. I recommend for anyone.
5,THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I EVER PURCHASED ON AMAZON!!!!!!!,2021/10/6,"I started my car -with no problems.  it was perfect.  sometimes you look at a review, and .. well it was written by the cousin or someone.  Not here.  I came without expectations, and walked away with the best item for a car I ever bought..It worked as advertised, and it was perfect...."
5,Highly recommended,2021/7/15,"Very satisfied. I used it on a dead and bad battery of my minivan and It didn’t have any problem to make it start again.
It charges it super fast any device that you plug in.
To Fully charge it takes about 30 min."
3,Easy to use but not enough power,2021/7/7,"Easy to use and fast charging, however, does not have enough power to start a diesel truck with 2 batteries in it. Nonetheless, the specification needs updating."
5,"Easy, worked perfectly",2021/2/28,"This portable jump starter worked great right out of the box. My wife’s car wouldn’t start after sitting in the garage for most of the winter. The way it was parked made it difficult to use jumper cables, and this seemed like a useful thing to have around.

I attached the clips to the battery as per the instructions and the car started right up. I charged it fully afterwards with the AC wall charger and it was fast - about 20 minutes from 50% to full."
5,Dead Car battery,2021/12/27,It works great.  We have a 2006 Sonata that has been sitting in our garage with a dead battery no lights for months.  The charger as advertised was easy to use.  Since the battery was dead I had to force the charge and the car started.
5,A good buy,2022/3/3,"Small enough to carry in car or on motorcycle. Powerful enough to start a diesel.

Don’t leave home without it."
1,Not worth the $$,2022/5/4,"Used it twice will not work has a error code 2, its junk do not waste your time or $$"
5,Definitely worth the buy!!!,2021/4/28,"Definitely worth the buy! Packaged well, well made, simple instructions, nice big led screen, I really like it! It charged my dead battery in my 65 Mustang V8 331 Stroker right up. I’m very impressed. I also picked up the carrying case(worth it). It’s well made and the speed charger recharges it from 0-100% within 15min. Now I can move my regular jumper cables to my older truck and keep this in my newer suv."
5,Good as expected,2022/4/2,Not the cheapest option but it’s well worth the money. Buy cheap get cheap… you know? This one can handle very nicely. Well constructed and looks durable. 100% recomend
5,Perfect Size!,2021/7/18,Great size. I have yet to be able to use this but when I do I'm sure I will be pleased. Good quality purchase that anyone who has a car should invest in.
5,amaaaaaazing,2022/3/11,works like a charm on my v8 Chevy Tahoe!  and it charges soooooo fast too!!! recommend!!!
5,Excellent Product!!!!,2021/6/3,"I personally feel that anyone who owns a car should own some version of a jumpbox. This one is a great choice because you are also getting a flashlight and a backup phone battery, and if you have a roadside tool that uses cig lighter port a battery for that as well. And the LCD display makes it easy to know when to charge it. It charges in less than an hr too. This product is amazing don't be caught on the road without it."
5,Just in case,2022/5/26,I bought this hoping that I never have to use it. Seems like it’s well made.
5,plenty of power,2022/4/1,"has plenty of power, cables could have been a little longer but they get the job done"
2,DIFFICULT TO USE,2021/10/19,"The worst thing is the tiny button to activate jump start. Short lived after a few months , having had little the battery expanded and broke the case."
5,Brings a dead vehicle back to life!,2021/9/1,I use this booster to start a Chevy motorhome with a 454 that had not been cranked in 4 years. The booster started it even without a battery in the motorhome.
5,Works awesome,2021/7/7,"Car battery was completely dead, jump started for 15 minutes with no luck. Hooked the battery pack up, pressed the fast start buttons and she fired right up!"
5,does work,2021/12/28,have used it a few times it does start the car  an still have enough  to start another one  handle to have
5,Great product,2021/1/18,"I bought this product because it is user friendly. It tells you when it's ready and it clearly displays the power level of the jumper. Overall, it's a bit thicker than i anticipated but, it works well. Easy to use SOLD me"
5,Exactly what I needed,2022/1/24,"Just received charged as instructed works as expected
I used it with 3 day I had it. It started heavy duty diesel with no hesitation
Top quality look and packaging with top quality results"
5,Product is awesome,2022/2/17,"Product is awesome but they took 2 weeks to ship it, if you can find it elsewhere I would buy it there"
5,As listed,2021/7/18,Started my f150 0 with out any effort when I left the door lights on all day.Batterys old.On with my day righty o.should come with a cloth case though?
5,Works great,2022/5/13,Works and is well built. I also purchased the case and it fits great.
5,It works great.,2021/11/8,"I finely had to use it, twice, and I was impressed with the Alpha85 jump starter.  A great item to have.  Money well spent."
5,Will buy again,2021/7/25,"Out of this world amazing , easy to use and did multiple jumps and still has battery left
This is an amazing product with no regrets"
5,Top tier. Maybe even the best on the market,2022/5/4,"This thing's size, look, and ease of use are really hard to beat. And it has the feature set and price to match. If you are thinking about getting it, just get it."
5,Great jump starter,2021/8/9,Works great and does the job. Did some research and this seemed to be both reasonably priced and effective in starting a dead battery. Good buy and worth the $100
5,Love the Hulkman Jump Start Battery Charger.,2022/5/10,"I love this Hulkman.
It has charged so many vehicles and lawnmowers.
Quick and easy.
My Husband loves the Hulkman Jump Start Battery Charger."
4,It works,2020/12/20,Works as it should would’ve been nice if it would I had a case for all the accessories
5,Glad I had it...,2022/3/21,"I didn't expect to need to use the JumpStarter, but I have used it twice.  It works very well."
5,Heavy duty,2022/2/8,Lots of power. Holds a charge. Larger than my last one and won’t fit in glove compartment
5,Awesome product,2021/7/2,"I bought this to use on my 5.9 cummins, but I also work with heavy equipment. I have used this to jump start a Dodge 5500 with the 6.7L and and a 7.7L Hino. All my co-workers were highly impressed and are looking into getting one for themselves. The only downside I saw is that when jumping equip of that size is that it drains the battery very rapidly and needs to be immediatly recharged. That being said it charges back up rather quickly. highly recommend and would purchase again"
5,Well worth the money.,2021/12/9,"Within the first 2 weeks of owning, I used this 3 times on one charge and it worked perfectly. I'm very pleased."
5,portable jump box,2021/6/1,"the jump box work as describe, it started a truck with a dead battery with no difficulties. i recommend this to anyone for peace of mind and service when needed."
5,BUY IT TODAY!!!,2021/7/8,"LOVE IT!!! Small, powerful, easy to use, and keeps a charge for many months. What more could you possibly want out of life!!! Buy it TODAY!!!"
5,Convenient and Easy,2022/3/23,I have a 2004 Ford Explorer with a bad alternator that I can’t afford to fix right now so I have to jump my car every 4-5 days. Super easy to use and uses about 2% charge for each jump. Well worth the purchase to relieve anxiety over your car not starting reliably.
5,Very impressive,2021/2/24,I was truly impressed with this battery backup/starter by Hulkman. From the moment you open it you can tell this is thoughtfully designed and engineer. Components seem high-quality and top notch. Have used it twice and have been extremely satisfied with the performance. Would highly recommend.
5,It Works!,2021/5/11,"I work at a car lot and use this jump pack all the time, 5+ times a week. I use it several times before having to charge it again. From slightly bad to completely bad batteries, I've gotten this to work EVERY time. Got it at a great price, but it was well worth it. I don't have to lug around the 20lb jump packs anymore, I just take the Hulkman around with me and it just works. And the charging is extremely quick."
5,NICE JUMPER,2022/2/18,"Convienient jumper unlike the 20 lb bboxes, strong as well and can charge phone with usb port"
5,Great product,2022/5/10,This works just like it said it would. My motorcycle battery was stone cold dead and it started my bike in 1 minute.
5,Excellent product,2022/1/6,"Beautifully engineered, simple to use, worked like a charm (every time so far).
Easily 5 stars!"
5,Power Plus,2021/7/24,"Fantastic.  I had a completely dead battery.  Hooked up the cables and the green light ""ready"" message came up in less than a minute.  Put the key in the ignition and started right up.  Nice that it arrived already 72% charged."
4,"Easy to use, just a little pricey",2022/1/28,"This thing would start a lawnmower, motorcycle, small car, and maybe a truck if it was close to going."
5,HULKMAN Alpha85 Jump Starter 2000 Amp,2022/5/3,"Got to use it last week on a John Deere riding mower battery, it worked!"
5,Works great once I figured it out!,2022/4/14,This works great but it took a bit to figure out. Read the directions and on the unit.
5,Fast charge !!,2022/2/15,"Great for all aspects of life . Start cars ,take on camping trips , fast charge !!! Highly recommend !! Going to get a even more powerful one for my camping trips !!!"
5,Good looking!,2021/3/1,First of all it jump starter for an automobile so its not at all warm but it is very thick and heavy. Shipped and arrived quick and charged very fast have not had to use it yet
5,Awesome,2021/10/10,"Been on a couple trips where I leave my raptor for a few days with my Cobb tuner plugged in and it drains the battery if I don’t unplug it . This bad boy jumps the truck no problem, and multiple times on the same charge. Charges fast and keeps the charge. Great investment"
5,Great device,2022/3/10,So far it’s help me with my dead battery as I live in a cold state my car wouldn’t start after overnight freezing temperatures. My only negative is that it doesn’t come with a carrying case like other similar models I have that make it reasonable to keep organized in your car.
5,A nice device,2021/6/19,A nice device that weights a lot less than the jump box it replaced. Easy to use and holds a good charge with a display to show charge level.
5,And amazing little Jump pack,2021/2/3,Does more than advertised I have jumped started a 6.6 liter Duramax and it started like it had a brand new battery on it
5,Great product to have in your car,2022/3/21,Great product to have in your car. I love how light weight snd easy to use.

5,Great and as advertised,2022/1/13,The unit arrived at 79% and reached 100% within minutes of charging. First try and worked perfectly. Now have it charged and the unit in our vehicle if needed.
5,Excellent Jumpstarter,2021/2/17,"I bought this to keep in my motorcycle and thankfully haven’t had to use it on my bike yet. However, it did help a buddy in need.
Only thing I’m waiting on is the official case to buy."
5,Great Jump Starter!,2022/3/28,"Would prefer for the battery cables to be a little bit longer.  That said, the HULKMAN was SUPERB!  It started my Chevy Silverado truck instantly - previous starting efforts using another jump starter and also traditional cables connected to another vehicle did NOT work nearly as well.  HULKMAN was instantaneous."
5,Useful,2022/2/15,Bought it for my husband.  Works well.  He doesn't need to call AAA every time his battery dies.He recommended this to his friends.
5,Great to have,2022/2/22,"Had to order this late one night because I got in my car and the battery was dead. Came in, plugged it in to charge and was done in about an hour. Jump started my car and was out the door with little loss time."
5,Off to a good start!,2021/8/22,Jumped two vehicles already. 2nd day of ownership. V8 and V6. The ready light is a great feature. It let's you know that you are hooked up.
5,Works great,2022/3/8,Quick charge is awesome feature. Also love the ports and LED lights. It worked first time for jump.
4,Very happy with this,2020/12/19,"Seems very well built, as long as it works better than the noco gb70 I got rid of and replaced with this, I will be extremely happy. Only giving a 4 star rating due to the fact that a case is not available."
3,First impression,2022/3/3,Just received today. I hope the box isn’t any indication of product performance. Will update after first use.
5,Helped me,2021/8/7,"About two weeks ago my new trucks battery died and I used this to jump it when I got stuck, it helped a lot and is easy to use."
4,Wish I had known,2021/8/21,Love this product but wish I had known in the information sheet that your battery cannot be fully flat. It has to have some life in it already in order for this to boost it. But still keeping it.
5,Great Product! Highly Recommend!,2021/5/13,"This thing has massive amounts of power, especially for its size. Charges very quickly. The screen is easy to read. The flashlight fuction is nice. Very well made. Quality seems excellent."
5,Must have trunk or glove box accessory,2021/3/17,"In today’s day and age of more computers in cars this is a must have. My push to start vehicle would not turn over and I was getting error messages on the display.

Using the jumper pack could not have been easier. It connects to the battery and displays “ready” when it’s correctly attached and ready for use."
5,Great Product,2022/4/5,"I was out of the country for several weeks and the battery discharged on my car. I tried using my bulky and my daughter's portable jumper, to no avail. My neighbor brought over his Hulkman and it started my car immediately. I bought mines immediately. I haven't had to use it yet but I'm more than confident that it will perform when needed."
5,Works well and keeps a charge a long time,2021/9/3,Purchased for my son.  Recently had to use it after weeks in the car.  No issues getting dead battery up and running again.
5,this box rocks,2022/3/14,"I had to get a new jump box when my Cyntur died. This jump box is on a whole other level. The box charges fast. Devices connected to the box charge fast. I just used it to jump a dead, cold 6.5 ltr diesel. It fired it up on the fist crank!"
5,It’s a good quality product,2021/1/28,"The product is really good, definitely feels high-quality, the only thing I didn’t like is that it didn’t came with a bag to put it in or a little storage thing, other than that it’s an awesome product"
4,The BOSS for jumpstarts,2022/2/5,"Excellent to have for jump starts. Easy to use store in the vehicle and reuse as you can get multiple jumps from one charge. Only complaint is the jump cable wire is about 8"" shorter than I would like. Would like to be able to move the device out of the engine bay for starting."
5,Nice potable battery,2022/3/26,Works really well. It also has a light in case you have to use it at night.
5,EVERYTHING I EXPECTED,2021/7/8,I was able to use this right out of the box since it had a 85% charge on it.  It started up my 2004 Honda better than it would if I jumped it from my other car.  I am super happy about this product
1,It didn’t work,2021/10/19,Bought it to jump start my riding lawnmower.  It didn’t work.  Sent it back.  Did get a full refund.
5,Espectacular,2021/9/21,"Muy buen precio en relación a su calidad, materiales muy finos y buen acabado, me encanta su carga rápida de entrada y salida."
5,Vey Reliable,2021/4/11,"very powerful and and easy to carry around, 3-stars because they don't include a carrying pouch . I have cheaper one that comes with a nice pouch."
5,5 Stars!!!!!,2021/12/12,"Love the fact of the easy usage, and portable it is. The LED lights are definitely a plus in dark areas. The battery life on this thing is amazing. The charge capability it has to provide ranking power is awesome as well. Well worth having an easy to keep handy."
5,Very Good Jump Starter,2021/5/28,Used this to jump start 3 different vehicles with Dead batteries and charged my laptop and tablet all off the same charge. I only wish it came a case included. Found a light weight tool box that is a good substitute for the case
5,Great product,2021/12/6,Easy to use. Cars started right away.  Only challenge is storing it.  Guess I should buy the case.
5,Portable kryptonite,2022/5/16,"Now, I'm ready for Armageddon. Good luck to all......the end"
5,You care for the best here it is! Excellent product!!!,2022/2/18,"Referred by the man in the know.

5,Reliability,2021/8/5,My battery on my Mercedes died before my trip from California to New Jersey.  I had no time for service.  I bought this jumpstart and it saved my trip.  I had to used it on every break and it worked wonders.
5,It came with instructions,2022/4/29,It came with written instructions. May not be a big deal for most but for me try to do the things my husband use to take care of it is a great feature. It is really easy to use and understand.
5,Excelente para cuando te quedas sin Bateria,2022/2/21,"Excelente producto de muy buena calidad,  muy útil para una emergencia cuando te quedas sin bateria."
4,Quality product,2022/5/26,"I would have given this 5 stars but it doesn't come with a carrying case, I mean really? Besides that it's a great, powerful unit and I'm happy with the purchase."
5,It does what it is supposed to do and works well.,2021/8/3,"Very straightforward to use, powerful (charged a completely dead battery in a car that sat all winter on the first try), and quite portable."
5,one of the best on here!,2021/12/24,one of the best or thee best on here. works perfect and turns the car on with no hesitation
5,Great product,2021/3/29,"It worked straight out of the box, I used it to jump start my zero turn lawnmower"
5,Great,2022/3/3,Plenty of power to start almost any vehicle and super easy to use.
5,Beast of a charger,2021/7/9,This thing is amazing! I charged my battery that was advised to be replaced after not being used for 6 months. I had previously charged the battery which would last the one drive but after being charged for 10 mins with the Hulkman my battery has stayed charged and it’s been 3 weeks.
1,Works great to power and charge small electronics.,2021/3/27,"Used this to power 12v and charge GoPro during baseball tournaments. Used for over 4 hours continuous and never dropped below 60%. I have not used it to jump start a car yet.

Purchased in February it’s now December and it is done for. Will not purchase again. Less than a year of use and it will no longer charge anything."
5,Great car jump starter,2022/3/21,"Car jump starter - well engineered- met my expectations- recommend for car battery restarts.
Recommend the equipment case suggested by manufacturer. Not included in starter purchase"
5,IT IS A LIFE SAVER!! HULKMAN Alpha85 Jump Starter,2021/10/24,"Double save same day!!!!
Killed it night fishing didn’t pay attention to batt level; jumpstarted boat with no problem.
Get back to dock and realized suv dome, map, fog, and headlights were left on…
With a 47% charge it also jumpstarted our suv.

If you’re thinking of purchasing the HULKMAN Alpha85 Jump Starter stop thinking and pay the $100.00; wifey will repay her hero!!!!"
5,Easy to use and jumped my 5.7 liter Dodge Ram,2021/7/22,"Easy to use and jumped my 5.7 liter Dodge Ram.  It fits well under the back seat so I can have it when needed. Now that my truck battery has been replaced I may not need it, but glad to have it more so than just jumper cables."
5,Must buy,2021/8/19,This is the best thing that I have EVER bought. It never fails me and super easy to use! Bought one for my kids and mother.
5,So far so good.,2022/2/6,"Got product. Charged for 20mins. Took it to my dead truck 5.8L V8. The truck hasn’t started in over three weeks in Chicago with multiple below zero winter nights. Hooked up the two clamps and did nothing else till it said ready. It was only a minute or two. The truck started like it was fully charged. Impressed so far. I do wish it had a nice travel case, oh well."
5,Absolute bargain,2021/5/31,Bought this to jump my lawnmower whenever it starts acting up. So simple to use and powerful.
5,Great jump starter!,2020/12/18,"Great heavy duty product. It’s quality made and I haven’t quite put it to use just yet except for charging it, but so far so easy to use and handle. I think this product would be great for anyone that’s not familiar with “car stuff”."
3,Don’t buy if just using for phone,2021/6/26,Bought this to charge my phone hopefully multiple times in the field but only gave me like 3 charges 😂 other than that it works good for my car!
5,Took a little time to figure out how to use it,2021/10/1,Works great now that I know how to use it.  Doesn't come with a storage bag and everything is loose
5,Good purchase,2021/3/18,"Works great! Powerful and holds a charge for a long time. Would be nice to have a carry case provided though, but the box it comes in us fairly sturdy."
5,Good starter,2022/1/11,"So far so good.  Started everything I’ve put it onCar, truck,  riding lawnmower.  Holds a charge really good"
5,Awesome battery charger,2021/12/10,"This is a great charger, so easy to use and gives me peace of mind driving an older car."

5,Must have essential in your car!!!,2021/8/1,Absolutely love this jump start battery. It is fast and easy to use. It also charges very quickly and can be used as a back up to charge your phone or any other device since it has a type C and usb port on it.
5,Amazing product!,2021/2/17,"Great jump starter for its size. Off of one complete charge, I was able to jump off at least 5 vehicles. All the way from a fiesta to a dump truck. FAST CHARGING!!! I will be buying more of these. One for every car! Can’t praise this device enough. If you’re on the fence about a different name brand, don’t. You will not regret this purchase."
5,"High quality, reliable and everything you need!",2021/6/12,Awesome.  Best money I have spent in ages.  Works great.  Very easy to use.  Well made and packaged.  Has everything you need except the case and thats ok.  The chargers and adapters are most important.  Some jumpstarters of other brands don't include a 110 fast charger..  I have had issues with jumpstarters but not this one.  Other reviews say the same.I highly recommend and I'm buying another for a gift.
5,Peace of mind for moms on the go.,2021/6/13,Used it right out the box. The battery came 70% charged.  Started my minivan immediately. My kid has a habit of leaving the cabin lights on so I really needed this so I could avoid calliing AAA or a neighbor for a jump. Also love that it has a light accessory and charger. Don't  know how I lived without this.
5,Great jumpack.,2021/3/1,One of the best jump packs I have ever used. It is small enough and light enough that even my wife doesn't have an issue with it. I jump started 5 vehicles off of it and it still has an 86% charge. It even managed to instantly startup one of my vehicles that was completely dead. Plus works great as a portable phone charger for camping trips.
5,This thing is nice,2020/12/15,I just got it and haven't gotten to use it a jump starter yet but everything else about it seems really nice so far. This thing feels super solidly built. I'm impressed at the quality for the cost of it.
5,"Pure power, very reliable, could jump start a Mack truck.",2021/10/6,"It has a flashlight, strobe, flashing red light, fast charger for your phone and another slot too.  You can run an auxiliary device of it5 like it was a power port from your car.  Charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time."
5,Everyone with a car should own one of these.,2021/8/6,"Fantastic. Works great. I've used it a bunch for myself (trucks, farm equipments, etc) and to help others."
5,One of Amazon's Best Products,2022/1/19,"This little jump pack is easily the best value of any product I have ever purchased through Amazon. It has never failed to start a vehicle I've hooked it up to, and it holds a charge for an impressive duration. The charge meter is accurate and incredibly easy to read. Considering the price, I would have never expected it to be as well-made and solid as it is."
5,Simple instructions - easy to use.,2021/9/7,The riding lawn mower battery was completely drained after leaving the lights on. The jump starter cranked it right up.
5,Awesome jump pack,2022/3/17,"Works great and easy to use.
I've used it a few times on my m880 (military truck) and absolutely works great."
5,Worth every cent!,2021/2/5,Easy to use. It’s kind of tricky when you first attempt to start a car or truck . There is kind of an over ride which you have to do in order to start the vehicle. Thats by holding the two buttons (flashlight & charger buttons) for about 2-4 seconds . Then go start it . I charged it once and I have started 8 cars and it isn’t dead yet. One of the greatest starters I have ever bought!
5,Great reliability,2021/4/29,Worked great. Jumped a motorcycle battery several times on one charge on low 40 degrees that otherwise with stock battery would not start.
3,Not impressed with the AI,2021/4/15,It works good if battery has some charge. If it's completely dead it shows a fault 2. And won't even try to crank over. I had to use my cheap walmart jumper. Not impressed with the Ai part.
5,Wonderful and easy to use,2021/7/31,"This works so easy! We’ve used it on our car and our lawnmower and it’s fabulous.  I love how light, portable, and easy to use it is."

5,Power and versatile,2021/3/15,This is one of the best jump boxes.  It has a clear display and plenty of power. Also works great for accessories even an air compressor.
5,Started my tractor on it's first day.,2022/4/5,"Love the size and weight. The energy available to start 12-volt systems is amazing. I replaced an aged out, lead-acid unit. This is so much more portable. Can fit in a glove box. Clean, easy to use and works. I used it to start my big mower right out of the box."
5,Great little problem solver!,2022/1/7,"This product is small and compact, easy to use and gets the job done!"
5,As spected,2022/2/4,Get the job done and is a good quality jump starter

Have jump started 6 so far, charged 2 IPhone 12’s, and a portable walkie talkie. Still at 82% power.  If you buy this  purchase the carrying case at same time. I didn’t and regretted it.  Bought case later that week."
5,Not one single bad thing about it. Simple as that!,2022/2/14,This is one of the best purchases ever! It just works. I just jumped my motorcycle that's been sitting out in the cold new england weather and it was completely dead. It started right up! The jumper only dropped from 100% to 98% charge. Totally recommend it! The best portable jumper I've ever owned easy.
5,Great Jumpstarter!!,2022/1/31,I bought this for emergencies. My daughter was visiting and her battery was was totally dead. With the Hulkman it started right up!!! I was afraid of jump starting with a second car and regular cables as I had no idea how to do it. These were so easy to use.

3,Not what I expepected,2021/10/15,"Wasn't what I expected and over priced. It took over an hour to charge my cell phone and the battery life went from 100% to 47% during that time. I figured if it could charge a vehicle battery in 5 mins, it would be super fast charging my phone"
5,These are simple and safe to use,2021/8/17,"I love these so much I have 2, one in each car just incase. It starts 7.4L motor in a boat nicely!"
5,Excellent product a must have in every vehicle!!!,2021/6/9,"This jump starter from hulk man is a life saver!! I can’t believe how much power this little guy has.  With no hesitation It started my V8 SUV that didn’t even have a battery in it. Very rugged, it feels like a high quality product built to last. Extremely portable Super fast charging and many uses per charge. I started my vehicle about 6 times and the hulkman85 still had 70% battery. Can’t recommend this product enough."
5,Works Great,2022/2/12,Works great and is small enough to take anywhere.
5,Does what it’s supposed to,2022/2/9,I’ve one used it once. I bought it for my truck but I used it on my Infiniti. Fresh out of the box it got my car started no problem. Highly recommend.
5,Funciona perfecto en motores grandes v8,2021/12/23,"Exelente, funciona muy bien con motores grandes v8 5.4 Litros
Lo recomiendo."
5,Have used a couple of times on my 6.2L gas engine.,2021/10/1,Performed as advertised. Get a ammo box to store it in. Lots of accessories.

5,Amazing,2021/6/5,"This jump starter is amazing. The day after I received it, my car battery was dead. I connected the jump starter to my battery and it turned on the car immediately. Very impressed. Even after using it twice, it still has a charge of 93%. I highly recommend."
5,Can replace bigger jump packs,2022/2/4,Compact yet Powerful. Check all the YouTube reviews.
5,It’s a good buy.,2021/7/15,Feature packed and works well. It’s been a great purchase and the Prime price made it even better.
5,Worth the $,2021/3/2,Annoyed this went on sale a mere 3 days after I got it BUT it def charges fast at home and cranks the car up no hesitation.
5,If you don't have it...get it now.,2021/10/17,This is the best booster pack I ever owned. I even got my brother's to order them one once they seen how mines operate. Also It brings a none charge battery to life. Do if you don't have one get one now!!!! Don't miss out!!!
5,"Looks very well designed, rapid charge",2022/4/27,I like the size and the speed with which it recharges
5,Convenient peace of mind,2022/1/1,"Having this item provides peace of mind, that should I need to jumpstart my vehicle, I have the easy to use Hulkman 85. I bought this item because my truck battery died at work while I was in a chemical plant, and someone with one of these used it to jump my truck with no problem. Just one use will pay for itself over having to call a tow service…"
5,Very happy.,2021/5/22,"I can't believe I almost paid more than twice as much for the ""other"" one.  This does everything and more."
5,Works great!,2022/3/23,Works exactly as expected. Easy to use
5,Great portable jump starter & battery bank,2021/1/8,Quality construction nicer jumper clamps and accessories all have very nice cables. Comes with a fast charger for recharging the device.

Hooked up the hulk man and it fired right up like it had a brand new battery!!! Still have to replace battery but was able to get far out of snowbank to work on!!! Definitely recommend it!!
5,Wish I brought sooner...,2022/1/25,I have had to jump my vehicles multiple times during the pandemic.  I purchased an inferior one before the Hulkman.  I wasted my time.  I recommend to do your research before making any purchases.  Works great for vehicles that have not been sitting dead for a long period of time.
4,Should come with bag or something to store it in.,2021/8/13,Used once and so far so good. This is way easier than trying to jump with another car and long cables. Only thing that would make this better is if it came with a draw string bag or something like that to store it in.
5,Great Product,2021/12/30,"Already had a portable jump starter, but it wasn't able to jump start a car with a dead battery.  Order HULKMAN on Fri @ 9am it was delivered that same day @ 9pm.  Sat charged the unit and jump started my car.  I highly recommend this product."
5,Great jump starter,2021/10/5,I use this jump starter on my 2nd generation Prius and it works every time. I use it on the jump ports under the hood instead of the 12v battery in the back which is difficult to access and it still works. This is a powerful jump starter and it works on many different vehicles. Great product.
5,Portable charger,2021/11/2,I leave my van parked for long periods of time and this product helps me start my van on the first shot and its a Diesel
5,Very impressed....,2021/2/24,"Great product.  Packaging is great.  Charges fast.  Bummer there is no case,  but I found one that would work.  Very easy to use for a single female.  LOL..."

5,Great Jumper,2021/2/28,"This jumper came in handy, used a few time on my friends truck and motorcycles,  still on running on 1 charge. Had it hooked up the wrong way and had a warning ⚠️ and protection circuit.  It's a beast."

5,Awesome,2021/6/19,"Able to jump start a Lexus LX570 5.7 liter engine with a dead battery, with no problem. The customer service is outstanding, they reply to e-mails quick and really take care of the consumer."
5,Worked great!,2021/4/10,"Had tried large battery charger/booster and jumper cables to a suburban battery while engine running, engine would not crank.  First try with Hulkman it started on first crank.  Hulkman really spun the started strongly and still had 89% after it worked and started the engine!"
1,Product Doesnt Even Work,2022/5/1,"Tried jumpstarting my car, will not work, waste of money."
5,"Wonderfully Built, Full Featured Must Have Device",2021/6/28,Fantastic product and coming from a AAA technician… THIS is the only device that competes with NOCO
5,I need the Alpha85/Alpha85S HULKMAN Alpha Jump Starter case,2021/5/29,"I need the Alpha85/Alpha85S HULKMAN Alpha Jump Starter case, every unit should come with the right fit carry case."
1,Product did not work at all its garbage,2021/8/10,It doesnt work at all i tried several times read all instructions did not work its basically garbage and a rib off

5,Fantastic product. 👏👏👏👏,2021/5/24,"I’ve bought 3 different portable jump starters and wasted hours researching which brand is the best.
Wish I would have found this one first, best way I can describe this product is imagine if Apple started making portable jump starters.
This would be it. Built like a tank. Fast charging. And they have thought of everything."
1,Confused,2022/3/7,"Doesn’t seem to work, instructions seem simple enough however the item is unresponsive when hooked up and a full charge"
5,Unit stays charged for at least 10 months,2021/4/15,Excellent product used for starting our cars and boats we have stored over the winter
5,Excellent,2021/7/12,I've only had to use it once so far. Was the first time ever jump starting a car and I was able to do it in under 3 mins because of the clear instructions and led display which prompted me
5,Believe the hype.,2021/7/1,My car keeps dying since I work at home all the time. This is my answer. No more car jumps for me. Freedom at last. So happy with my purchase

5,Easy and we'll built,2021/12/24,"Very easy set up and foolproof instructions,  unit seems very well made . Would have liked a carry bag for the price otherwise I love it"
5,Very Good.,2022/3/22,Quality product. I'm happy.
5,Best portable jumpstarter,2022/3/17,I have a camper and as every camper knows the battery dies in a few days. This jumpstarter cranks the jack and opened 2 slides by itself. I was really amazed.
5,Excellent product!!,2022/1/3,"I used it on a near dead motorcycle battery, and it worked like a charm! It was also very fast to charge! Totally recommended."

5,Does its job well (I have a 401cu V8 nailhead Buick Wildcat),2021/9/13,Bailed me out a couple of times — works great (my car has a big block engine). The ability to use it for charging a phone via USBC has also been a life saver. Why otherwise keep a charging bank in your car that can’t charge a phone too? Only issue: would love a cheaper case option.
1,Beware of the Rippoffski,2022/1/16,Piece of junk. Never worked and support evaporated.

This provides this and so many other options.
Emergency phone charger, etc."
5,Few dollars more for a premium product,2021/1/16,"I gave this as a gift and I paid a few dollars more compared to the budget option on Amazon.

It was worth it. This had a great “unboxing” experience as a gift and the product itself looks awesome with the digital display and etc. We haven’t had to use it to jump a car yet but the instructions and steps are dead simple for just about anyone."
5,Amazing device . So pleased with it 5 stars no doubt.,2022/5/11,"One of the best purchases i have ever got ,got my first one and i lost it and ordered the same one cuz its on of the best .in general very efficient and heavy duty device .

5,I was pleased with the results,2022/3/15,"When I read all the reviews I was spectacle at the beginning.
Then I said I will give it a try, and it didn’t disappoint.
Worked really good and was easy to use!
I highly recommend it."
5,Works perfect,2022/2/27,Works perfect. Look at reviews speaks  for itself. Way better than a jump box

5,Excelentísimo,2021/12/31,"Excelente producto,lo recomiendo"
5,"Funny name, but a great product.",2021/6/10,"The name feels very masculine, which is silly to me. But the key features of this jump pack would be the battery indicator, ease of use, and long term battery life. I would recommend this jumper to any of my friends."
5,great jump stater,2021/10/16,Used several times for my neighbors.  Great product
2,Kinda useless,2021/6/9,I am a contractor for AAA so you can imagine how many jumpstarts i need to do a week. Using this product i was only able to jump maybe 3 cars out of the 50+ cars i had to jumpstart. For whatever reason it just wont let me jump just about every car. The battery was at 100% charge most of the time only got it down to 80% on the same charge before i returned it.
5,Just started to use it; no word on long term quality,2021/7/20,Unit packs a big punch! It charges up quickly when connected to 110
5,Easy to Use and Powerful,2021/12/6,Have the Hulkman 85 and the NOCO equivalent GB70. Have used both for years. Hulkman is the way t go - power and ease of use. Just hook up Red to + and Black to - and the unit turns on and does the rest. All automatic.
4,Handy,2021/11/18,I like it but if the battery your trying to jump it  completely dead it won’t work
5,Great tool,2022/1/11,More powerful than I had imagined.  Does a great job boosting for such a small item.
5,Better than the ones that cost more and that are heaver,2022/3/22,powerful and light weight
5,Great starter box,2021/8/24,"Used to jump f150, twice in about 1/2 HR, still showed 90% charge"
5,Delivers as promised,2022/2/28,Nissan Titan XD battery drained to zero.  Hulkman turned it over immediately as if I installed a new battery.  Best $110 spent in a long time.
5,VERY Impressed,2021/5/30,Best purchase I have made in years. Was really surprised by how lightweight and small it was given its power rating. Setup was extremely simple and it worked flawlessly on numerous vehicles/tractors the first weekend on the farm. Charges VERY quickly.  Could not rate highly enough.
5,De gran utilidad,2022/4/12,"Fácil de usar, adquiere la carga rápidamente"
5,It does what it says it is supposed to do!,2021/7/9,Finally got a chance to use this battery jumper and it worked perfectly! I would recommend this battery jumper to anyone!

5,Great product,2021/11/29,"I just used this to jump start my Toyota Prius. I usually don’t do reviews but this is  awesome! It works like a charm and so easy to use.  And it’s fast to charge, after my jump start the battery went down to 75 % and it literally took 2 minutes to charge it back to 100%. I wish my iPhone would charge as fast"
5,worth the $$,2021/2/16,Great battery charger! My bf has used this 3 times this week on his car and it's been so reliable.
1,The 12v out spec not accurate,2022/5/14,"The 12v outlet will not run a 100w air pump or other device.  The specs say it does, but it doesn’t.  My Hulkman 10.0 does this but the 8.5 does not.  Returned as actual does not match technical specs."
5,Keeps the charge longer than otgers,2022/1/26,Needs a casé to carry. It's a bit heavy
4,Peace of Mind,2021/10/27,"I haven’t had to use the Hulkman yet but it does give me a peace of mind when traveling. Portable, heavy duty. Has more functions than expected (usb charger, light)"
5,Works great!,2021/6/13,This is great and very easy to use. I have used it for 3-4 times to jump start my honda accord and still holding over 80% charge. Great product!

5,Great product,2021/7/9,"One of the best purchases I’ve made lately, holds a charge and no battery leak, has saved me and fellow drivers multiple times, Definitely a buy"
2,nunca pude encender mi carro,2022/2/15,"cuando llego lapuse a cargar hasta que llego al 100% y nunca tubo suficiente fuerza para encerder mi carro
muy mala calidad, a pesar delos demas febacks los cuales hay muchos positivos en mi experiencia nunca me funciono el start ...."

5,Great Device Gives Peace of Mind,2021/2/6,Lots of power. Charges rapidly. Compact size so stores easily. I no longer have to rely on others or akward vehicle placement to start a car with a dead battery.
5,Works great,2021/3/1,Used it for three starts from a QX 80 and a 300z works great every time and a quick charge
5,It works!,2022/3/3,It took three attempts to start my Mazda Miata with a completely drained battery (not even a click before applying the Alpha 85 leads).  Very pleased with the product.  Really works as advertised.
5,Go,2020/12/11,Bing
5,Works fast and easy to use,2022/3/29,Used it for charging battery.  Fast charger.  Easy instructions.
5,If it doesn’t work try this,2021/6/24,This thing works well. The only advice I have is if you hook it up and you get an error signal look at the back and it tells you what to do. I was trying to jump off my Prius and received an error signal. It told me to hold down on the power button and flashlight but not the same time and I was able to jumpstart the car.
5,Worth every penny.,2021/7/22,Thin thing is awesome. Helped me with my truck that had a completely dead battery. Turned it on without hesitation. I have used it a few times and it does its job!
5,Extremely fast charging,2022/1/24,Small and efficient
5,Quality Product,2022/2/12,Super quality product! I carry it on my Harley for myself and anyone else who drains a battery. This product is rugged and well built. Just wish they included the carrying case.
4,"Great product, great idea!",2021/5/27,Seems to be very well made and sturdy! I haven't used it yet thank God! But it seems like it's a great product.
5,Like charging your iPhone,2022/3/4,"This portable battery booster is so easy to use, that it feels like you are charging your iPhone not your car.  Amazing product."
5,I bought this for use on my 5 motorcycles.,2021/11/26,"Stores easily in Saddle bags, panniers and sidecar trunk! Easy to use. Would recommend for ALL motorcycle riders."
1,Does not work,2022/3/31,"Hi,

Not sure how this sells. I bought few months ago but I am unable to use. Even at 100% charger battery, the car never notices any power. Tried multiple times though."
5,Powerful,2021/8/3,"Unplugged the battery terminals on  a Toyota 4Runner just to try out the unit before actually needing it. Started the truck with no hesitation, no slow winding up to full power, just straight to full power to crank without delay. I never thought these little boxes could pack that much punch."
5,"Saved me and coworkers over 7 times , never charged and 52% battery life still left.",2021/11/8,This is well worth the money. Will start a completely dead battery and still have plenty of battery life left for many more.
5,This thing has POWER!,2021/9/11,"I have a slow drain on my battery.  Can't figure out where it's coming from, however, even with my battery completely dead, the Hulkman started my truck instantly.  I can't recommend this product enough.  The power it has is kind of mind blowing when you see how small it is.  Great product.  Thank you."
5,Read your information.,2021/12/2,Compact and easy to use. Works great.
5,Quality,2021/2/19,Appears to be quality made very easy to use I would recommend it. There is an anything I don’t like about it.
5,The most important to know that this brand Hulkman Alpha85 are so quality material and product,2021/5/8,I love it this portable car charger easy to use and convenience to handles.
5,Good product,2022/2/24,Good product. Sleek design. Easy to use. Compact. I got the carrying case as well. I have a repair shop so I've used it several times already. It's so compact I was able to sneak it into a car auction.
4,It is not easy to use on side post battery,2021/12/3,Not so easy to use on side post
5,Easy to use and works great,2022/2/23,Product works as described. I was able to get several jump starts off one charge for my 2002 Tahoe. The cables are a little shorter than expected and it would've been nice to have some kind of carrying case or bag.
5,Works really well!,2021/10/15,Started my car pretty much instantly!
5,Easy to operate.,2022/5/17,Easy to operate.  Works great!
5,Life saver,2020/12/29,Good god this is a life saver. My trucks wiring harness is off and the battery keeps dying so it jumps it right away every time it decides to die. Also great for charging my phone on the go. The USB-C is a great add on.
5,Doesn't work below specified temperature of +5 degrees F,2022/2/14,I am very happy with this product. I use it to start my 5.6L V8 Nissan Titan which has a common cold start problem. User beware that it will display an error code and will not work below the specified temperature of 5 degrees. The fix is to bring it inside and let it warm up.
5,It meets the need,2022/1/13,Just what I wanted
5,Very portable!!,2022/5/7,"My husband saw someone that had a smaller version and was amazed and just had to have one.  This one will work on his tractors and of course, can go anywhere with him."
1,Stopped working after 6 months,2022/1/20,Great for the time being but it stopped working after 6 months with barley any use at all terrible for the price staw away from crap made in china
5,8 liter 8 Cylinder Suburban with dead battery started EASILY!,2021/7/5,"Wow!  My 8 liter 8 cylinder Suburban has not been started for 10 months.  Battery is completely dead.  This Hulkman worked perfectly!  Because the battery was dead I had to use the ''forced output"" option.  So easy.  so quick.  Only used 6% even with this dead battery and behemoth engine."
5,It works flawlessly,2021/7/1,It’s kept in my truck and when boating I take it with me. I’ve started a boat that killed their battery with Electronics running. Saved them from a Sea tow bill. I also don’t jump tart from my vehicle bad for the electrical system.
5,jump starter,2022/1/21,Very Pleased
5,Essential Equipment!,2021/7/14,"Excellent!  One of my best decisions ever !  Super easy to use, easy to charge and good for many months In your trunk, providing peace of mind and independence… no more long cables cluttering your trunk, no more hoping for a Good Samaritan to give you a jump, no waiting for expensive road service!  Relax and go !"

5,Excellent jumper,2022/2/12,I have had to use it several times already and it works very well.
5,Great Product for Auto Emergencies,2021/1/18,"Great product! My ‘08 Corvette had been sitting idle in the garage after I was gone over an extended period of time. Coming back, I tried starting it and no go. A friend of mine had good luck with this product so I decided to give it a shot too. It worked like a charm starting my vette up and you can tell this thing is heavy duty - craftsmanship is very good. Will definitely recommend to others."
5,Peace of mind...,2021/2/2,"I bought this for my wife’s vehicle.  It is plenty powerful for her van, easy to use, and provides great piece of mind should she ever find herself with a dead battery.  Also, an easy way to help out a stranded friend, if the need arises."
5,Best yet,2021/5/17,Perfect does exactly as it says it can. Beautiful quality as well!
5,Better than expected,2021/9/1,"My expectations where low, but so far I have been proven wrong ,the boost feature is great. Have jumped  8 different vehicles in a weeks time without having to recharge and still haven't plugged in to recharge.  Has about 40% left. Only thing I would personally change is having longer leads 🤷‍♂️"
5,Simple for anyone to use,2022/4/10,You connect and the light tells you when ready to crank.
5,Worked very well.,2021/7/19,A high quality product that works exactly as described.
5,Excellent!,2021/9/15,Impressive.  Had a dead battery on a 1972 Chevelle SS.  Connected the Hulkman and it started right up.  Extremely worth it!
5,Awesome for everything,2022/3/20,Small and does exactly what you want it to do!
4,Must have,2021/2/11,Start up a dead battery with ease no complaints for product way more convenient than jumper cables
5,The most important thing to me is the quality of an item,2021/3/16,This thing is unbelievable it has decent weight to it so you know you're getting a solid battery the craftsmanship is great the layout with the digital readout is simple and nice to have I bought it because I had to buy a used car and didn't trust the battery so I'm keeping it in there I may even buy another one there's a gift I like it so much
5,Great jump starter,2020/12/19,"So far I’m very impressed with this jump starter.
First day I had it I used it to jump start an old 1/2 ton pickup that had been sitting for months with a dead battery. It started the truck instantly and it still had 94% battery left on the jump starter. Seems like it could easily start a lot of vehicles before needing recharged."
5,Car jumper,2021/9/11,It works exactly like it says! I jump my car and many others also! Highly recommend!
5,Must have,2021/7/7,I have an infinity QX80 and they are known for battery issues. We took a long trip and when we stopped for gas the truck wouldn’t start like the battery was dead. We hooked up the hulkman and it immediately started the truck without hesitation. Definitely a must have in every car and we’re putting one on our boat.
5,WORKS WELL.NO ISSUES,2021/8/14,I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT
5,Great unit.,2021/5/21,Great unit for size and portability. Would recommend.
5,Works as advertised,2022/1/31,We have a v8 Savanna van.  Started it up like a breeze.  I'm impressed.
3,It's ok,2022/2/5,The Battery charge dont last
5,It works VERY well.  I like it.,2021/7/21,"tried it for the first time on a car I own that sits enough to occasionally need to be jumped.  It lit that thing up like a brand new, freshly charged battery.  This jump pack is so much easier to use than jumper cables or a battery charger.  It now goes in the trunk of the car whenever we travel."
5,Everyone needs one.,2021/7/4,These are awesome. Jumped my 4.3l without a battery twice then jumped my 5.3l with a totally dead battery. And you can actually charge if off a type c phone charger.
4,Works great but quickly has charging issues,2021/9/27,"I go to charge the device for the first time after the initial charge. It starts at 68%, and then says it is charging but stops at 75% no matter how long you let it charged. Perhaps, this is not a problem and will charge back up to 75% each time, but it causes an unnecessary worry if that is a working feature."
4,I would buy it again,2021/3/14,So easy a cave man can use it.  Pretty much does the work for you just connect to car battery or device and you're notified when its good to go.  In a crunch it will definitely help you get back to busting move$! The led lights strobe and red emergency functions will light up the night or be sceen by motorists or emergency personnel at night.
5,Fast charging and rugged.,2021/2/14,Looks like the pictures and feels sturdy. The display is really nice and functional. Came mostly charged and topped off blazingly fast.

5,Excellent,2021/7/9,Love this started a big truck up in no time

5,Good jump starter,2021/7/22,"Very good jump starter, plenty of power"
4,"Simplicity, safety and ready for whatever.",2021/1/19,"I do like the display, makes it look really cool. Although I thankfully haven’t had to use it yet. Charge time was great everything looks super easy to use having the usb type-c was a big plus for me.  Only time will tell but I am happy with my purchase thus far."
5,Wirks great!,2021/3/24,Great starter. My battery was dead. Yukon XL. Hulkman body slammed it into submission and it awoke in seconds!
5,Quality build,2022/3/27,"Excellent booster pack, got it with the case and it’s amazing!"
5,Everybody need this tool,2021/7/16,Land Rover discovery series 2 i used this morning and I don’t need more than 2 seconds to be ready to go.
5,"Excellent device, high quality",2021/7/16,"Everything about this device has a quality feel. The jumper cable springs are strong, the jaws open wider than my old cable clamps, jumping my car was so fast & easy, it charges my phone, the cables included are high quality, every port has a dust cover that feels solid & stays put. I'm very satisfied!"
1,No lo recomiendo,2021/6/5,"La carga no dura nada, de 3 a 5 intentos y baja a 60%"
3,Not reliable,2022/4/19,"When I need to use it, the ready light doesn't come on and it won't work unless that's on. When the battery  gets down to 85% it won't work !!!"
5,Excited,2022/1/28,I feel like killing my battery so I can use it already dam but it looks promising
5,Versatile and easy to use,2021/3/12,Super easy to use. Battery was dead and it brought it back to life. I also used it for a camping trip and it was very useful as a flashlight.
5,Saved the day! Battery stayed charge for a long time!,2022/1/16,"Bought it a while ago - when I needed to jump start my car today, it had 95% battery left! Saved the day!"
5,Great product,2021/11/3,Works great
5,Superior product,2022/1/21,"The superior quality and workmanship impressed me the most. Solid, sturdy, and convenient to carry and use. Far exceeded my expectations."
5,"Solid sturdy build, easy to use, lots of features and versatility",2022/2/11,"Much smaller than a jump pack, makes it easy to store under seat inside car. Can charge devices via USB, nice large display, host of over under charging safety features. Makes for a versatile battery pack for camping or gear bag for truck."
5,The jump starter worked great and the Customer Service from Hulkman was superb at fixing a problem!!,2021/10/12,Seems well built and worked great.
5,Great emergency equipment,2021/12/11,Reliable easy to use
4,Works Like A Charm,2022/1/19,Quick tip: hold both buttons for a couple seconds if the battery is completely dead and you're not getting the READY light to jump.
5,Fast charge,2021/10/22,Used it several times. Once for my Mercedes’ sprinter and several others time for providing help to others. Definitely well worth the purchase
5,The Hulkman is reliable and safe for repeated or occasional use.,2021/3/15,I like that it charges quickly and holds its charge for an almost unlimited amount of time. You can also charge a phone or wireless device when the power went off for a whole day.
4,Seems to work good so far,2021/6/23,Dislike the 10 minute lock out
5,Excellent charger,2021/3/25,I like it because it is compact and has thick wires on the cables.  Also was charged up to 65% when I received it.
3,Not 12v out,2022/4/1,"Seems well built, jumps car as it should.Does not come with case.  My biggest issue with this is tge “12v out” actually puts out 16 volts, which causes my inflator to give an error message.  So useless to me for that purpose."
5,Heavy duty,2021/12/1,It has sufficient power to recharge my car battery.
5,This is so convenient!,2022/3/14,This little battery starter is awesome. It is easy to use and very compact. Nice not having to use my car to jump start a battery.
5,12 volt led Bulb,2021/5/23,"I plugged in my 12 volt LED 2 watt light in, (the bulb was a12v to 24v rating) for 3 Hr's - it used 9% of the power. I'm very impressed !"
1,Stopped working after using twice,2022/4/3,It stopped working after twice I would not purchase this item . Not happy at all junk.
5,Car jump starter,2021/9/21,"Used it 3 times so far and it works like a charm. Had no problem jumping a  completely dead battery. Will definitely recommend having one of these in your trunk. Only issue Is that USB C connector will not charge my phone, it says imput/output. Still worth the buy though"
5,compact,2021/8/15,"very strong,,,dependable"
5,Problem solver,2022/3/27,I no longer have to call AAA for a jump because I can’t remember when I drove my truck last

5,It’s work really good!,2022/5/9,I bought this thing for the landscaping company that I work and we have a few trucks but I really test it with a Isuzu NPR Diesel engine and did it like a champ.
3,I have a smaller charger and that works quicker than this one,2021/10/31,Using it for the first time since I brought it had a hard time in jumping the battery in the car quickly and I use another one that I had smaller and that one. The car quick jump
1,"product is defective, will not charge",2021/7/21,opened and tried to charge. will not charge.
5,Worked like a charm,2021/7/14,I had not driven my car for over a year and the battery was dead.  I tried to jump with 2 different vehicles with no luck. I purchased this jump starter and it started the car with no problem.
4,Overall does the job,2020/12/9,Pretty cool product very comparable to the “other” brand. I would say it’s a bit more for the consumer than the professional in that it does not have a override on multiple jump start attempts if it feels that you are trying to much you have to wait 10 minutes for it to let you try again.
5,Works good does its job,2022/5/19,I like how small it is and works great
5,Very handy to have.,2021/10/24,"It had started our car several times because the battery had gone dead from not being driven. We did have to YouTube how to use it because the directions weren’t clear. However, it’s a life saver."

3,Awsome,2021/10/10,I’m a tow truck operator and I bought this jump pack and used it about 7 times on once charge easy to use and it didn’t take up much space in my truck
4,works good,2021/9/2,works very well
5,Powerful and clean,2021/3/14,Very nice product. Clean and powerful. I used it about 3 times so far. The one time I used it the car wouldn't start at first. So I checked the connectors and then it started right up. I love that it fits in my glove box. The connectors are strong and open wide.
5,Easy to use,2021/6/28,Works great. Started my car right out of the box before I charged it. Getting a second one so I have one in each car
5,worth the money,2021/7/30,my chevy suburban batterie died on me and i tried the jump starter and it worked very well. With in a minute my truck was running.
5,Should start a weak battery in a matter of minutes.,2021/4/17,Started my completely dead battery in my car after sitting for 6 months. Took about 20 minutes but worked flawlessly. Hulk was down to 49% and was recharged to 100% in less than an hour.

5,battery  starter,2022/2/3,my husband really likes it.  our son in law has one.
4,Has good power,2021/5/11,A little bigger and heavier than I thought and I wish it had come with a case or carrying bag.
4,Plenty of power,2021/3/11,Can’t speak to the longjevity only used one time on a dead motor home with a 7.5 engine it didn’t struggle and ready to start right away probably turned the engine faster than the battery alone!!! Some accessories were left on it started with them on
5,It's seems to be well built with the extra heavy duty cables !!,2021/7/29,"I never had a chance to use it yet, But it sure looks like it will do the job.... I bought this Alpha 85 to replace a Red Fuel I had... It conked out after one year !!"
5,Great Jump Starter,2021/2/7,"I was initially going with the Noco Genius GB40, but I stumbled across this Hulkman instead. It has everything the noco has, plus a big LED battery indicator, charges incredibly, and it has a fast charging for my Samsung galaxy phone. And, the peak amps are double than the gb40. I've used it 3 times already its been great."
5,Jumped a dead truck battery. No problem.,2021/2/14,Jumped a 1/2 ton truck. This Hulkman did the job when my friends little GB40 couldn’t turn the engine over. Highly recommend for jumping dead batteries.

5,Great jump starter,2021/2/19,Great jump starter! Highly recommend. We use it for all our cars.
4,Worked as described,2021/10/3,"Using this is safer for the car’s “brain” and related electronics in these newer cars.  Quick, simple, and nice to have a built in light."
3,Hulkman 85,2021/10/18,So sophisticated that it’s not easy to use…

4,Love this thing,2022/3/9,This has been a life saver. All though only gave 4 stars as some times it'll indicate its ready and will start my car instantly but then car dies and I'll have to repeat 3 or 4 times. Other times I only have to do it once.
5,My hulkman.,2021/3/12,"This thing is the bomb. I have used it to jump my wife's car and my daughter's.

1,Dead battery in the middle of the desert and this thing let me down.,2022/1/6,"Went camping a few days ago. When it was time to go, my car wouldn't start. ""No problem!"" I said to myself. I can finally use the Hulkman I've been keeping in the car just for this occasion. I was actually pretty excited about it. Well, excitement turned to disappointment when it wouldn't start my car. I could tell it was doing something, but it just didn't have the juice to work. I have a 3.5l V6, so it's not some crazy engine. I had to walk a couple miles till I was able to find someone to give me a jump. Very disappointed."
4,Ode to Hulkman,2022/3/13,"I don’t often write reviews but this product and its reviews inspired me to do so. I might repeat what others have said – apologies in advance.
First, Alpha is the best. I have tried all the other brands and so know this as a fact. The others are not the best. I use the jump starter as the manual states and the ad shows, I connect both leads directly to the battery and put the jumper right next to the terminals. The ad says “0 zero damage” so it must be OK to do it this way despite safety recommendations from everyone else. The ad also points out that Alpha “can incent jump-start all kinds of 12V vehicles.” I know this to be a fact even though I sometimes don’t fully agree with the incentives Alpha uses.
The tech specs and ad state this device puts out 2000 amps and can give “60 jump starts on a single charge.” My car battery is much larger, only puts out about 100 amps and will not do 60 starts without recharging. This shows just how amazing this jump-starter is – it might be because of the “#1 AI Smart-Chips.” I am not sure about this because I am only familiar with AI dumb-chips and wouldn’t know the #1 smart-chip if it slapped me.
This baby keeps its charge. I put this in a ’65 powder blue convertible with black seats and new tires Mustang but forgot about it. I hadn’t driven the car in a long time, actually never because it is not mine, but when I went to start it, the battery was dead and my heart sank. Despite these challenges, I measured the car battery deadness so that I too can confidently say it was 100% discharged, not 70 or 80%. Then, like a foggy siren call, I remembered the Alpha. It had slipped under a text book on volatility and systematic risk; I pushed the book aside, got the Alpha and saw it was still at 100% charged!! I hooked it up and varoom went the engine after some incentives from the Alpha.
This is the best and it is amazing. I even carry it around with me in dangerous neighborhoods – want to meet my Alpha 2000 amp Hulkman, sista or buddy, as the case may be. What a great name!
I’ve taken one star off because the ad shows a case and it did not come with a case."
5,It does things others cannot ... BUT it doesn't come with a case.,2021/2/10,"For this price it would have been dead simple to include a case, even if it were a cheap zipper case, so all the parts could be stored together with the battery pack. Instead I have to go shopping for something other than a disposable plastic grocery store bag to keep everything in -- very inconvenient. For a device this well built you would have thought the manufacturer might have included a nice, tough case with the brand name proudly visible on it. But they did not so they lose one star.

Fortunately the unit itself has plenty of power and can start cars and trucks with completely dead batteries ... or no batteries at all. The ability to do this is more than MANY of the cheaper lithium ion jump starter units available online these days, and in my opinion this is a critical capability of any so-called ""jump starter"".

I definitely recommend this product. It's the most powerful on the market and works well."
5,Built Like a Tank. Excellent Performance.,2020/12/6,"I’ve tested a lot of brand name and generic versions of portable jump starters and this one though I haven’t heard of it before, is one that I rank high up on the list. It feels and performs like some units that are twice as expensive. It is solidly built. It can handle the typical environment where it will be used in. The occasional fall, thrown in a storage bin, put here or there, it is built for it. My favorite features has to be the easy to read display. It is large, simple to read and gives just the right amount of information without over doing it. It is quick to power up, performs like it should, and charges quickly. This unit is an excellent value. 5 stars."

12/06/2020
You will not be disappointed at this heavy duty pro-graded jump starter.
The large status LCD screen is awesome. As you can see from the attached picture, it is currently 100% charge. It has been a week since it was unplugged, and it still hold at 100%. The led light on one end is bright enough to get things done at night. On the other end, there is a USB port to charge all the chargeable devices. On the 6th of every month in 2021, the hold charge will be updated. Let’s see by December 6th of 2021, how much charge is left in the device

5,Everybody needs one,2022/1/2,"Awesome product! Got tired of dragging out my husband's charger, plugging it in, then waiting. This is so easy to use, light enough for me to handle and works in a wink. It doesn't spark and scare me. The display is large and bright- thank you! I love it and need another one to keep in the other car. No more dirty jumper cables. I do wish it had a carry case or bag but I used one I already had. I would definitely recommend this for low vision folks like me. Get this product."
1,Broke withen 3 months,2021/7/28,Was a great jumpstarts but quit turning on for what appears to be no reason after owning for 3 months it’s should be under warranty and I will change the review if I receive a new one
5,Move over expensive brand name battery booster. There is a new competitor on the block.,2021/6/12,I didn’t intend to real life use a week after receipt. But it worked easily to jump a weak/dead battery. Honda v6. It was pretty easy and straight forward. The fact that it comes with a fast charger and 2yr warranty blows away the competition and for less. I did get it on additional sale. So the question will be to see how long this sucker lasts. Doesn’t come with a case for the value you get it’s not a issue at all. Always have jumper cables. This is just for convenience.
4,Hulkman Jump Starter,2021/11/4,"Received the Hulkman Alpha 85 jump starter (2000A) via Prime in the usual Amazon packaging and shipping times; arrived promptly with adequate packing material and no item damage.  The manufacturer of this device has taken a made in China product and instilled accurate build standards into the product line.  From the extremely detailed manufacturer packaging, to the well written user instructions, almost as if they've taken a page from Tim Cook's Apple manual.  All of the included ancillaries are very well made: solid copper (not plated) jaws on the battery clamps with strong springs and the plastic is not brittle or have sharp edges, the 12vdc car plug is made with quality connectors on both ends and good phenolic backstop inside the receptacle behind the (+) terminal (not cheap plastic), the AWG (wire size/gauge) used throughout the product is oversized and appears to be of good quality in terms of stiffness although I did not remove the insulation to check whether solid or plated copper wire was used.  The product arrived charged to 66% and it took barely over an hour to reach 100% via the 65W included wall charger which has a 30"" cord attached to it and uses standard 115VAC plug with a USB-C connector that mates to the input of the jump starter.  Most amazing is how simple this particular starter is to use, you merely attach the clamps via one connector that mounts to the end of the device, turn it on, and start your car.  There is no pushing buttons with a time restriction in which you have to attempt to start the vehicle -- simply hook it up, turn it on, and turn the car key...just that simple.  The Hulkman comes with a reverse or incorrect clamp polarity indicator lamp to ensure you have the device connected to the suspect battery correctly, also has a digital charge indicator, status, and discharge icons in the digital display.  The cables on the clamps are approximately 24"" long and the device is quite heavy compared to others I have owned, meaning I suspect they're using more batteries internally.  Overall very pleased with the device, its operation, and quality of manufacturing."
5,Great jump starter,2022/1/23,I read the manual just so I knew everything about the jump pack.  I have used it many times including starting my 6.7l diesel truck when the battery was drained.  Have recommended this product to many friends.
5,A Really Great Product! BEATS NOCO!,2021/8/11,"Remember when you had to ask someone for a jump start? Thank goodness those days ore over! I use this thing all the time for more than just emergencies! I go camping often and love being able to charge my phone in the tent overnight. I also regularly use the light. A few weeks ago I helped a foreign girl who was having battery problems with her rental car. The Alpha85 just comes in handy all the time and is more than just a jump starter.
The Alpha85 is a really good value! It's not the cheapest but definitely not the most expensive, and it hangs with the best of them. I recently put to rest a NOCO GB70, a comparable jump starter that I paid $300 for a few years back. NOCO is probably one of the leading brands for portable jump starters
(or was) because they are pretty good, but they're expensive. Despite the price, I only got about two years use out of that unit before the battery swelled up and wouldn't take a charge anymore. Side by side, the Alpha85 which I only paid $100 for is superior in almost every way. It has a higher capacity battery, more starting amps, usb-c fast charging (with an included fast charger), and the list goes on. Nowadays the GB70 has come down a little in price and there's an updated version the GB75 but the Alpha85 still beats it! I have also had some cheaper jump starters that when needed just weren't up to the task. Sure they would work as a portable phone charger, but when needed, couldn't deliver enough power to start a car. You won't have that problem with the Alpha85; it's overkill for most cars on the road and that's how I like it.
For the same price as the Alpha85 you could go with the NOCO GB40, and yeah it will probably start your car, but it only has a 24Wh battery while the Alpha85 has a 74Wh battery. That's more phone charges, more flashlight hours, and then still being able to jump start your car. The choice is easy; the Alpha85 beats the more expensive units at a price almost anyone can afford. There's little excuse not to have one."
3,Medio complicado,2021/9/9,"Lo probé en el arranque en una F-150 6Pistones , gasolina !!!! La batería estaba muerta, use el booster y en un solo arranque cayó el voltaje de 100 a 76. Otro problema que encontré en el manual, es que no tiene protección contra la posibilidad de que se ""toquen"" por una casualidad las mordazas. Eso es una preocupación constaste a tener en cuanta cuando usas este equipo, de hecho, le quita más del 90% de autonomía y seguridad !!!!"
5,This is great to have on hand,2021/10/3,"I changed jobs I used to work less then 15 minutes away to a job about an hour away, decided  I needed a way to jump start the car if needed, well this is smaller then standard jumper cables, and you don’t need a second car!  I first had to use it on my wife’s car her car the computer locked up forcing the lights to be left on all day until I got home, battery was at 3 volts, too low for my battery charger to detect is was a 12 volt battery, hooked this thing up and was able to jumpstart within seconds.  I got her battery charged and tested and we were all good, until morning the car would not start again, so I charged the battery again and still nothing, this jumper pack was great for this it still could jump start the car, I got to my appointment, jumped and left again, picked up a battery, jumped and left to got home and install where I replaced the battery. Where I had to run the pack in the special mode for dead batteries to keep the computers alive I. The car.  After all of that the battery was still at 85%, this thing is amazing!Now for the downside, it only fast charges with the included charger, this is USB-C it is a standard if the manufacture follows the standard then any 65w USB-C charger should fast charge.  I know it is nitpicking, but the IT world is moving to universal charging, if you are going to use that universal connector you need to adapt the universal standard too."
5,Exelente compra,2020/12/17,Es muy vueno
5,Charges really fast and works,2020/12/4,"So I found out recently that I could not jump other cars due to the terminal placement under the fan in my Honda Pilot.  Really dumb design if you ask me, but I digress.  Over the years I have often volunteered to help stranded motorists with a jump.  This is really nice to have on hand.  It charges super fast and is supposed to hold its charge for over a year.  We will have to see about that.  As an added bonus, I plan to use this as a battery supply pack when camping."
5,Excellent product,2020/12/20,East of use
5,THIS ONE WORKS,2022/1/22,"I have had a few other brands of jump boxes like this none of them really performed. They would barely start the car.

This HULKMAN ROCKS!

Very simple operation and easy to follow. You hook it up hit the button and the car starts PERIOD!

Others I've had to use in the past you would need to leave it hooked up for 7, 8 or 10 minutes and then the car would barely turn over and start.

I only got this the other day and use it on a 5.3 L GM engine and 6.2 L GM engine. It was about twenty degrees out and both batteries were completely dead. I had to use the force start feature on this and as soon as I held down those two buttons within one second and the truck started right up and it only reduced the charge on the unit by 5%. Unbelievable! And when I plugged it in to recharge it took less than 4 minutes.

This unit is top-notch and fantastic I love it"
1,Fake reviews,2021/6/7,"It is physically impossible for this thing to deliver 2,000 amps of current... especially, given the size of the provided leads.

Also, 20,000mah sounds cool, right? Its about 4 times the size of your phone battery. Its big enough to push 20amps for one hour, before dying. Its 20 amps, at 12 volts, for one hour.

But... yea. Its impossible for this device to deliver 2,000 amps, without instantly vaporizing the leads, or causing the lithium batteries to overheat. For reference, I have 0/4 gauge cable to connect 12v batteries to an inverter, for 600amps."
5,Such an amazing device,2022/3/12,"I bought this thing a while back, and kind of forgot that I had it. I charged it initially, and put it in the back of my car for emergency use. Well, that emergency happened today. I was already running late for an appointment, went outside to start my car, and my battery was dead. Remembering that I had this charger, I grabbed it and looked through the simple instructions. My heart kind of sank because I thought it would take a long time to charge the car's battery to the ""ready"" point.

But it didn't! I hooked up the charger (which still ready 100% capacity despite sitting un used in my car for months), and within literally 10 seconds the ready light came on. The car didn't start the first time, so I had to do it again. The next time, the car started right up. This brought the battery of the jump started down to about 70%.

It was so easy and so fast I could not believe it. I made it to my appointment on time-ish, and when I got home I plugged in the jump started for recharging. Using the provided fast charger, that also went unbelievable quickly. It went from 70% back to 100% in about 5 minutes. I put it back in the car for next time.

Highly recommended! Without this device, I would have had to hook up a slower battery charger or find someone to jump start the car with their vehicle. It's so great to have the peace of mind that I can help myself in these situations and not need to rely on others."
5,FIRST IMPRESSIONS,2022/2/22,"Purchased the Alpha 95 directly from the Hulkman web site, but it was shipped through Amazon Logistics.  My comments today are based on initial first impressions.The package arrived VERY quickly and product was well packaged.  Everything about the Alpha 85 screams quality.  First rate packaging and operating instructions.  And this thing is built like a tank.  VERY solid.The jump started was 81% charged at arrival and took less than 30 minutes to fully charge using their supplied high power fast charger.  Fast chargers combined with lithium batteries always concern me a bit so I would not ever leave this charging unattended, and use ONLY the charger that comes with the product.The switches all operated smoothly and with a positive feel to them.  Access to the connection for the jumper cables was easy.  Access to the charging port and the USB connections is a bit more difficult due to the methods used to provide the water resistance ratings and the size of the plug.  I would suggest to Hulkman that have an indentation or some type of pull tab to help grasp and remove the plus would be useful.  The jumper cables themselves have larger clamps and slightly thicker cables than their competitors.  This is of course a good thing.  The only negative side to this is that their added size combined with the size of the jump box itself makes the entire package a bit heavier and larger.  The Hulkman may not fit in some vehicle storage spaces that smaller devices might easily be stored within.The addition of a 12 volt out receptacle and a cigarette style adapter is one of the features that drew me to this jump started despite already having one of a different brand.  As an emergency responder that provides me with the ability to run my vehicle's LED emergency lighting from the Hulkman instead of leaving my vehicle locked and running or in accessory mode draining the vehicle battery.  I also liked its ability to bypass the safety features and started a vehicle with a COMPLETELY dead battery.  Many if not most of Hulkman's competitors do not have this feature, which may be why many people think that a jump box failed or is defective. The safety systems that verify the proper connection REQUIRE that a certain amount of power remains in the battery being jump started.  If that voltage is not present the jump box cannot detect the battery and will not allow the jump start to continue.  Hulkman gives you a way to bypass the safety systems and jump start a COMPLETELY dead battery.  When using this method you MUST make sure that you have all of the connections right and everything is safe to proceed.  Failing to di so could lead to a battery explosion from EITHER battery and trust me, that is NOT a good thing and can lead to serious injury of even death.  Know what you are doing before using the safety bypass feature!Once again, all of my comments are based on initial first impressions.  It may be some time before I actually have an opportunity to try the product.  In closing, I have read many comments form people who used a jump box like this a time or two and then they failed.  Some people have been upset about the ""wasted"" money.  Consider this...If ANY jump box saves you the price of a couple, or even ONE tow or jump start service call then the device has most likely already paid for itself.  If the Hulkman is designed and built as well internally as its case and accessories are....Then it should provide you with great service."
5,Robast!,2021/1/18,"I backed Hulkman on Kickstarter and i have only positive words about this jump starter. I impressed with built quality and power. I have had bad 12 volt battery on my Prius and i gotta jump start it every morning. Who has Prius can understand me why it is really hustle to jump start these cars. Hulkman helped me out to make it much easier because of size and versatility. I have few things wish they improved. First, it has smooth surface and reason why i say it because it can easily slide and fell off from surface. Need some sort of rubber case to hold it in place. Second, is clamps. I had hard time to grip negative cable clamp to screws because of texture of teeth.  And the last one is the case - I got free case with my kickstarter order but didn't get it with this order."
1,Shady Company,2021/12/30,"Product seems to work for now, but I'm skeptical of its longevity.

They say register your product for a warranty extension. Which also subscribes you to their email list. And if you unsubscribe they'll void your warranty.

Another reviewer says they want serials if you make a warranty claim, even though the serial is not required for warranty registration. The serial is only on the flimsy outer paper of packaging, which most people won't keep.

Sounds like a scummy company."
5,Wows you right out of the box!,2021/8/23,"First off, the packaging is impressive. Slide off the outer wrapper and it is like getting a $1500 cell phone in a box. So well presented and well packaged. Includes a ""C"" type USB cable, cigarette lighter adapter for powering items that would plug into a car power socket, heavy duty wall charger and the battery jumper cables. The jump starter was 79% charged right out of the box and was fully charged within 30 minutes using the 65 watt wall charger which showed ""speed"" on the readout.

This is an impressive unit that looks and feels quality. The closures for the external connections are tight and well formed, and I believe they will deter any moisture intrusion. The cables are long enough for the standard battery poles and also for under hood connections where the battery is in a remote area of the vehicle. The charge and information LCD is really bright and readable, and the instructions are clear.

The boost feature that allows jump starting a truly dead battery is a big plus, as many will never know the charge state of their battery when it has insufficient power to start the vehicle. Many jump starters will not allow use if the battery is missing or totally dead...this one does.

Two additional thoughts...this can be used to charge your cell phone, laptop, tablet and power many devices that use 12 volts through the cigarette lighter adapter or 5 volts directly through the USB ports. And finally this has a bright LED light that has multiple settings, high, low, flashing, SOS and then a red flashing LED light for roadside emergencies.

A great item to have in your vehicle or at the ready in your garage when extra battery power is needed for almost any reason."
5,Love it everyone needs one of these,2020/12/3,"This unit has everything you will need to jump start your vehicle when the battery is dead. It comes with all the accessories to charge and use it. It will even power your tech equipment. It has a nice case to protect and store the charger and its attachments. It's a nice compact and well built unit. Great gift for anyone. i keep this in my car at all times and has come in handy helping friends or stranded motorists. this has paid for itself several times over already and i know i have convinced others to buy one when i saved them in minutes with mine. with technology the way it is and the price point of these things very affordable there should be one in every single vehicle on the road in my opinion. if you dont have one and are reading this review just buy it you will not be disappointed and the first time you dont have to call for a jump start or tow it will pay for itself and you wont have to wait for anyone. this has plenty of power to jump start everything i have used it on. even at work with the larger pickups start a completely dead truck easily, I have literally jumped 8 vehicles already and have not had to charge it. it holds its power too even if not used.  I just used it the other day with a power inverter to power up my modem and router during a power outage to have internet access. i love this little thing"
5,"I had high hopes, Hulkman doesn't disappoint",2021/2/9,This replaced my Noco jump starter and so far I've had zero regrets. First off the packaging is very nice making sure nothing gets damaged by separating the accessories from the main battery. The unit is fairly heavy compared with other units being sold on Amazon but I usually associate that with a quality product. The black lcd screen is a nice feature and gets lots of compliments as well as the rugged rubber molding protecting from bumps and bruise's. The accessories that come with it all feel and look like high quality cables. The jumper cables and connector are same quality as the Noco and much better then any of the other brands I've seen. I like the needle nose design it allows for more versatility when connecting to smaller terminals. My favorite thing is the charging cable as it's so amazing how quickly it charges the unit up. I haven't left it in my vehicle overnight it sub freezing temperatures as my old Noco would be dead after a few days and I just got in the habit of bringing it in every night. I am really waiting for summer to hit when we take our Jeep out in the back country camping for days at a time and use these devices to recharge all sorts of items. My main reason for purchasing the Hulkman over some of the similar sized units available was the fact that this is being offered by an American co. and I like supporting new start-ups and feel if I have any issues they will take care of me. The one thing I wish they would have done is include a nice padded zippered case instead of the fancy box and padding it came with. The cost to them would have been on slightly more and I would have gladly paid more for it as well. I just used an plastic ammo can with some layers of an old foam sleeping pad to separate everything. So far works good when rock crawling and stuff is banging around in the back. I've got my eye on a Hulkman 100 for my work truck when they become available.
2,Won't start a Big Hemi.,2021/4/3,I got this for Christmas and finally had a chance to use it. I work in EMS and we have a Ram Power Wagon with a 6.2L hemi that was dead. I thought I'd try it and it said ready the truck just clicked. Let it sit for about 3 minutes and the display dropped to 90% and tried again. Still won't start. Let it sit and tried again. Nothing. Grabbed our big lead acid battery jumper and it started no problem. So won't start the big Hemi. Maybe it will start something smaller I don't know yet. So for now I have a $100 phone charger. If I get a chance to try it in a smaller engine I will update my review.
5,The biggest and the best. Big Rig starts everytime!,2020/12/8,"I am cursed with bad luck when it comes to batteries. No matter their age or vehicle I manage to kill them unwittingly. Thank the maker in the past few years there are now these portable jump packs available that aren't the size of a car battery themselves. They also have much more power to boot. Personally I believe everyone should have a jump pack in their car right next to their jumper cables. You may never need to use it, but Id wager you'll run into someone that will. It also saves your car from any unnecessary jumper cable issues (you can cause real damage to your car if you hook them up incorrectly). With as little as they cost you should have one for every vehicle you own. I have 5 of them (yes 5). One in each of our three cars and one in our boat and our RzR. The last two are pretty critical as you dont wanted to be stranded in the dunes or in the middle of the ocean.

However not all of these batteries are created equal. There are the smaller ones that are insanely portable, yet dont have the starting AMP's needed for anything larger than a small V-6. They are great for 4 cylinders and smaller v-6's but anything that requires a lot of umph youll need to get something larger. I have a large 8 liter diesel that I rarely drive and is always usually dead when I need it. I have tried all my previous jump batteries including another large one I have for my v10 excursion. However none of them have the power to start it. I relented and just figured something of this size cant be adequately jumped. So I would break out the charger and hook it up for 8-12 hours until it got enough juice to charge. Thankfully I got the hulkman (better name than most of these batteries) and gave it a shot. And boom first try it fired right up. In the cold no less!!!! This thing truly is the ""HULK"" it provides more than 3x the power of the next largest battery I have and hardly uses and juice at all. Granted it is bigger, but not so much so that its obtrusive! Like everything in life there are pros/cons though

Pros:
-As powerful as they come, it could probably jump start the space shuttle
-Comes with a quick charger (can charge from regular USB port as well)
-Has a flashlight
-Will jump many cars before dying

Cons
-Its big! Twice the size of others
-Doesn't come with a case, at this price point it should as there are several parts to keep track of

All in all this is the best bang for the buck charger you can get. If youve got a BIG motor or just want that extra peace of mind than you gotta go HULKMAN!!"
5,Incredible Jump Starter!!!,2021/6/18,"Wow! What an amazing, solid product. Overall, incredibly impressed by this jump starter. Very clear display and is very easy to use. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. Super helpful to have in your car for emergencies!

I bought this on a whim when my car battery was totally dead and received it the next morning with prime overnight shipping. This is a very well put-together product. The batter packaging was very high quality similar to what you'd get with an Apple or Samsung phone. The jumper was charged at 80% right our of the box. I used the included charger and got it up to 90% in less than 5min. This thing charges SUPER fast. At 90% I hooked it up to my 2020 Subaru Crosstrek that was completely dead. I pressed the Power and Light Button simultaneously to enter Force Start and my car turned had power instantly. I turned the ignition and it started up first try. The battery went from 90% to 79% with the jump. I charged the jumper again and got to 100% in less than 10min. Like many others, I'm note one to write reviews unless the item or service is really really good or really really bad. This definitely falls into the really really good category!"
5,The most impressive battery jumper I have seen and used.,2020/11/30,"The Hulkman Alpha85 is one impressive looking battery booster. I've owned several well rated chargers before but they typically stopped working within a year. Glad to see off the start that the Hulkman brand offers 2 years of protection and lifetime technical support. Physically, it is larger then the units I have owned before but it is well designed with ip65 protection which I have not seen with other brands. The bright and colorful display is easy to read and honestly just cool to look at. There are so many great features about this unit that are head and above anything I have used before.
Pros:
-Absolutely powerful 2000 Amps peak cranking amps to start vehicles with up to 8.5L Gas/6.0L Diesel engines.
-65W Super Charge: 1.5 hours to fully recharge (When arrived the charger had 69%. Fully charged in 10 minutes)
-DC port charging
-USB-C charging port. Finally a up to date charging port instead of some proprietary connector.
-Ip65 rated
-ergonomic clamps that are easy to use
-tons of safety protections to prevent you from damaging your vehicle or injuring your self. Just correctly connect the jumpers, wait for the ready display and start your vehicle.
-18 months standby power. (the picture misspelled months, just saying).

Cons (Not really but its expected)
-Large size which is understandable given the battery capacity.
-Connector may be difficult to access because the IP65 rubber seals are tight. Again understandable but should be mentioned to prospective buyers.
-No protective case. Even the cheapo battery chargers had some nylon protective case. This one does not.

Overall a real solid unit for the price. I watched the kickstarter promotion and felt confident that the product they were providing was substantial in design and performance. So far it has met my expectations. 5 stars."
5,This thing is a must have brilliant life saver,2021/12/20,"Bought this last year and used it for the first time today. I hooked up a light bar to my Ram Warlock a few days ago. Totally forgot to turn the switch off when I got home from work last night and when I got in my truck to go to work today  the battery was almost stone dead, couldn’t turn the engine over.  Hooked this magnificent little machine up to the battery and got a #2 error code, looked that up and it means battery is under 8v , uggh this is going to be expensive I bet,  but this godsend of a device has instructions on the back telling you to use the Force Start function, so I follow those simple steps, the unit immediately says READY and I’m skeptical as I turn the key.  Well the truck roared to life, I made it to work only a few minutes late and I have the unit recharging on my desk in case I need it again.  I have complete faith in my Hulkman.Buy it , just buy it. Best investment one can make for their vehicle. It’s an amazing product that works as advertised.  And so simple to use."
5,Amazing Product and Great Customer Service!!,2021/8/13,Update .... I must have received a bad one. Great Customer Service took care of me and replaced it. Exactly what I wanted it to do and backed by a company that cares about what they sell. I take back my last comment.
2,"Misleading, Not true 20000mah battery capacity!  Divide by three for correct 6667mah is correct",2022/4/15,"The battery capacity is rated for 20000mah or 20ah, but this is for all the batteries in parallel at 3.7v not at 12v.  So the 3s capacity for 12v is only 6667mah or 6.7ah.  Much less then what is really useful to the consumer."
5,Best In Class,2021/3/16,"As someone who ordered my first Hulkman on Kickstarter and now just ordered a second thru Amazon, I can say this is the most convenient starter on the market. From the size to the features it is spot-on. Easy to use and the boost feature will start an engine other starters will not.
Only disappointment is that Amazon does not offer the original case.
Buy it!"
2,Very poor User Guide,2021/6/22,Very poor User Guide.  No information whatsoever about how to recharge the unit itself.
5,small works great,2021/10/28,"Got this for my boat in summer and truck in winter. Charged 4th of July, in Aug it had 95% power left and started boat rightup"
5,Impressive,2021/10/25,This thing is so impressive; it's a confidence inspiring gadget!
5,Perfect,2020/12/31,This power block is awesome charging is fast the display is bright easy to use.
5,Fantastic,2021/10/18,This jump starter is worth every penny. Amazing something this size has this kind of power. Super easy to use too
5,Fast shipping,2021/7/8,Like
4,**Updated** Watch out for the warranty claims,2021/10/31,"***Update***They did replace the defective charger.  The device itself had worked fabulously.  I used it regularly for about 2.5 weeks while i argued out a warranty issue on a battery until i could get it replaced.  A normal jump used less than 5% of the battery, and 3 forced jumps to a completely dead battery used less than 40%.I'm still only giving it 4 stars, because the warranty requirement for a serial number they only place on a disposable wrapped.  That still seems shady.  If you buy this, keep the paper wrapper from the box,  &/or record the serial number on it.  I'm not sure if they only replaced it because I'm still eligible to return the whole thing to Amazon.I'll update this as things go along.  But if you buy this item, beware, if you need to claim a warranty, they want the serial number that is ONLY on the disposable wrapped slip of paper that's around the box. It's nowhere else.  I even registered my warranty on their site, and received a confirmation email.  Never a mention about the serial number.The sad thing is, the charger itself seems to be great.  The rapid charging cable came apart after about a month of semi regular use, which is why i contacted them about the warranty.TL;DR Good product, they lie about the warranty."
5,Worry reduced quickly,2021/2/13,"For a person that can not start their car, the worry sky rockets instantly.  The mild panic for a grandmother, wife, daughter or girl friend becomes very real very quickly.  Take that worry away.  This product supplies the needed power to start your engine quickly and securely.  The Hulkman provides the portability, power and safety required to get the car started.  Unless a mechanical problem exist or the car is useless, the Hulkman will provide the powder to start the engine.  Keep the original box.  It is perfect for storage of the Hulkman.  It also provides storage for the cables, and charging devices.  Great Product.  I just purchased a second one for my car."
5,Exactly what I needed,2021/9/12,"The only con I have is that I wish this came with a case so I can keep all the wires and gadgets in one place.
Otherwise? This is perfect
I participate in car shows. Inevitably a car almost always needs a jump. When dealing with vehicles that are 60+ years old it happens. Its a real PITA to try to get another car close for jumper cables and nerve wracking when someone you barely know is waving alligator clamps around your $5,000 paint job.
This solves it. I have jumped everything from my 64 Falcon to a 740 HP 69 Impala with zero issue in the last two months. Ive jumped my 1953 Ford tractor a half dozen times (got a bad ground somewhere I haven’t bothered to find).
But the best part is?
Multi use.
I don’t have a cigarette lighter in my 64 but there is a crap ton of ashtrays. Go figure. What that means is I cant charge my phone while at a show. But with this? I can.
Also gives me a flashlight so I don’t have to carry an extra in my bag in case something happens at night.
All in all this has been a great buy for me this far and been super beneficial.
Highly recommend."
3,"GREAT booster, BUT looses it's power when cold.",2022/1/19,"I purchased this item a few months ago and I have used it approximately 10-20 times. Works like a charm every single time, no questions asked. Jumps 5.0 V8 motor with a completely dead battery like it's nothing. HOWEVER, when it's cold outside it loses its charge FAST. It's rated for -4F, well that is not correct because even if it's 25F outside you will go from 60% to 0 in 1 start. Yup, happened to me several times. Yes, it charges up fast, but there is absolutely 0 reason why it should lose its power so much and so fast if it's rated for -4F.
If you live in a warmer climate state where it doesn't get below 32F definitely a great buy. If you live in a 4 seasons state keep that in mind when purchasing or purchase 85S model rated for -40F.

I purchased this regular 85 model when it was $99 which was a good deal, but at the current price, I would possibly try another brand with the same or better specs for a better price."
5,I would've paid $300 for this thing,2021/2/25,"I'm an automotive geek and practically spend more time jump starting my vehicles than I do driving them. My Corvette has been plagued by some electrical gremlins, causing the battery to die every two days, so I've been jumping it with a ""Truck Pac"" brand jump starter. That's one of the biggest jump starters you can get. It weighs almost 40 lbs, but it can start just about anything. I also have a smaller jump pack similar to the Hulkman, but it only has 360 peak amps, which is barely enough to reliably start a motorcycle.

This Hulkman Alpha85 puts both of my jump starters to shame. It started my Corvette instantly without even a stutter. It's even MORE powerful than the enormous TruckPac I've been using, while being small enough to fit in my center console. The Hulkman is truly an intelligent jump starter. The display is easy to read and shows the percentage of power left in it. If the jumper cables are connected incorrectly, it'll give you an error message. If your battery is completely dead, it'll give you another error, prompting you to hold the device's buttons for 2 seconds, then it'll display ""READY"", and then it's ready to jump start even the weakest of batteries.

Furthermore, this jump starter really does charge quickly. It arrived at 77% and charged to 100% within 10 minutes. At the time of writing this, the product is $80. It's so affordable, I literally just ordered another one. This product can give you peace of mind. You can just toss out your jumper cables because you'll never need them again. I recommend that everyone keep this product in their car. Best jump starter I've ever used."
5,GAME CHANGER.,2021/9/13,"I have never jumped a car myself. I was always afraid of screwing up the cables or electrocuting myself. Recently my car sat idle for 3 weeks and it was dead. I had dashboard lights but couldn’t get it started. I ordered this because I didn’t want to deal with coordinating with AAA and honestly, this has happened twice this year because I’m driving less in this global pancetta.
Anyway… I got this late one day, charged it up (took about 20 mins to go from 80% out of package to 100%) and the next day I took it for a trial!!
Popped the hood, attached the jumper cables to it, turned it on, clamped to the battery and VOILÀ (yes, that’s the word) … I got an error code. My battery was totally 💀. So, I did what the instructions say for a full start or whatever, held the power and LED buttons at the same time and boom, it said ready.

Got in, hit the start, that car started like the day I got it. HAPPY EXPLETIVES FLEW.

Just buy this. I’m getting it a case so it’s always nice and comfy."
5,This Saved the Day for My Wife,2021/10/5,"My wife's 2019 Nissan Armada wouldn't start last Tuesday and I had to drive out to jump start her car. We called the dealership and they couldn't get us in for weeks. The Armada seemed fine after I jumped it but I bought this starter for my wife, just in case the issue came back before we could get it into the dealership. Well, it came in and I charged it up. After a quick tutorial for my wife, I stuck it in her car, just in case there was an issue. Literally, the next day the battery issue happened again and she was able to use this charger to get her car started. I was floored since she has never jumped a car before and was nervous. It worked flawlessly on a dead battery. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a questionable battery or really any one I guess."
5,Great Product,2021/11/1,"This is without a doubt the best purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon!
It’s a great idea to have an item like this in your vehicle; other people may not have jumper cables or there may not be people around when you have cables.
I have, ignorantly, run my battery down by charging too much through my power port and since I don’t drive my truck very far each time my alternator doesn’t get to charge my battery enough. Six times, recently, I’ve had to jump my truck (4L V6) and each time it started immediately. After 6 jump starts, including my battery being flat on the first jump, the jump pack is at 74%. Obviously I’ve now charged my auto battery. I highly recommend this jump pack! It feels great in my hands, not heavy and not so lite that it feels cheap…. The perfect weight and size it feels like I’m holding a quality, solid product. I read reviews from other people and watched videos on You Tube prior to purchasing; everybody wants quality for their money so I knew that’s what I was getting…. Now I can confirm that’s what I have QUALITY!"
5,Amazing Product! Highly Recommended!,2021/9/14,"Super strong product! It actually will start a diesel truck 6.0l! Amazing Display and it charges any device! It let you start the car multiple times even if the battery is completely dead you can still start the car just press both buttons and Presto! 🤗 it charge super fast, and it charge with tule C cable too! I go to Car meets and shows and I don’t worry anymore about my batteries, and I’m also able to help others! Highly Recommended!"
5,Quality jump starter,2021/2/16,"Very good, solid, and high-quality charger. The packaging is amazing and the accessories are of high quality as well. So far, I have only used it once (on a KIA Sorento) that was left outside for a month. The battery was drained, but the car started right up.  With the supplied 65W speed charger, this thing charges 50% in 35 min. This jump starter also can be used as a power bank and supports quick charge, so it can fast charge your cell phone. With an average cell phone battery capacity of about 4000 mah, this 20.000 mah jump starter can charge a cell phone 4-5 times. There is also LED light, so you can use it as a flashlight on the go as well. All in all, it is a great jump-starter.As a minor con, I would mention that it is heavy and bulky, but this can also mean that the manufacturer used good high-quality components.  I would definitely recommend this product."
5,This thing is a life saver!,2021/10/19,"My BMW 328i started having battery issues where whenever I go several days without driving I would need a jumpstart. After AAA was leaving me stranded for an hour or more, I said enough was enough! I previously purchased a jump starter from another company and it didn’t start my car at all (1000 amp).

So I purchased the Hulkman 2000 amps and this thing started my completely dead battery in 2 minutes. It is the easiest to connect under the hood even though the battery is in the trunk. I use the alternative of jump starting from the engine bay. I have used it 3 times so far to jump start my car. It went from 100 percent to 73 percent for those 3 recharge. This is the best investment for any driver. I even purchased the Hulkman carrying case to keep all the accessories and keep it protected in my trunk."
5,Used for Harley,2022/5/28,"I reviewed this twice - I think I bought it in a bundle, so here is the other review.This is being carried on my bike across country, part of my safety kit.  I have used it to start a tractor so far - that worked really well.  The unit is clean, well designed, and packs a lot of power.  It also doesn't seem to drain power when not being used, it still had 100% charge after sitting for more than a couple months.It charges fast using USB-C cable (provided) and has a speed charge.  If you are looking for some insurance and don't want to screw with a lot of stuff, buy it.  I also bought the Hulkman case for it - worth it."
5,Best bang for your dollar,2021/7/15,"I'll start by saying I was somewhat skeptical about the quality of jump stater being it was made in China (many of the major brands are too).

I ordered 2 of these units and upon arrival I noticed they were boxed very well, had a premium feel (think Samsung).

The units themselves feel like that are made from good materials and well designed. The display is fantastic and the instructions are super simple. The clamps have 4 loops in the spring (very strong) and have a great feel.

The charger is 65w and charges amazingly fast.. Says it can charge up enough within 5 minutes to start your car. It can also double as a phone/GoPro/etc charger for on the go.

I definitely recommend this product."
5,Amazing! Robust! Totally worth it.,2022/2/11,"Honestly, this thing is amazing! It's super simple. Direct connect to the battery, no fumbling with the armature of the car. It literally tells you when you've got it right. Once you've gotten the green light (yes, there's actually a green light!) Get in the car and Bob's your uncle.

It's got a USB port if you need it as an emergency charger for your phone, tablet or whatever, and a led torch, because why not right? That's all well and good; But I love it because I need it to do one thing and do it well. This fits the bill 100%. I've already recommended it to my friends and family and everyone else who might listen. Do you're own due diligence."
5,Powerful and just the right size,2021/3/20,"I looked and looked at different models. I decided on this one even though I never heard of the brand. The basics, it’s a fast charge and a no brained turn on and off.

I charged it up and left it in the box it came in. Put it in my truck. 3 weeks later, my truck battery died. I opened it up and let it charge the truck battery as it says for about 5 minutes. And boom! My 5.3 started right up. Now the device had about 71 percent left. Later that weekend I had a semi dead battery on my side by side. The battery was good but had not been used the last 6 months due to winter. I used the device to charge battery and BOOM it started right up!

At the end of the day, I will be getting 2 more of these. Amazed!"
5,BUY IT if you need frequent visits from AAA.,2021/11/29,"I don't drive my car due to Covid. We now get everything delivered. So our car's battery goes flat because it consumes electricity until the battery goes dead, all modern cars are like this. The battery powers the computer module that runs the car, even when you aren't using it. My car is a Pontiac Bonneville with the Cadillac Northstar V8. I read the reviews here and bought this and hoped it would start my dead battery car. It took a few attempts to make a good connection on the jump start terminals under the hood. (The battery is actually under the back seat on the right.)
Needless to say, the car started easily once that was achieved. The unit showed that its power had dropped from 100% to 97% from that one attempt.
I'm a retired master mechanic and was dubious that a device smaller than a carton of cigarettes could do this. I'm a convert. Obviously, battery power has come a long way since I was a mechanic.
I am in no way affiliated with this product, other than to say if you need a jump starter, BUY THIS. It's like having AAA in your car for when you need a jump start."
5,Exactly what I needed,2021/11/19,"74 year old lady who has never jumped a car. Left back door ajar on my Jeep Cherokee after removing groceries.  Stupid senior moment. Dead battery 4 days later. Searched Amazon, read reviews and choose Hulkman Alpha 85. Delivered overnight.  Opened box, came at 77% power, charged while reading easy instructions 10 minutes at full power. Hooked up to car received error code for dead battery, pressed the LED and power button simultaneously per instructions for force start, immediate ready light and car started right up. This is the unit you want. It is a little bigger and heavier than the space savers but it's solid, safe and it works. Don't know about longevity but the bonus extended warranty card that came in the package it is warrantied for 36 months. Do yourself a favor and order the bundle that includes a nice hard side carrying case. https://smile.amazon.com/HULKMAN-Alpha85-Portable-Starter-Protection/dp/B09696NZK5/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Hulkman+85+bundle&qid=1637282689&qsid=137-0776868-2241968&sr=8-3&sres=B09696NZK5%2CB0978M6FXN%2CB08TW8NLTD%2CB08M41FX48%2CB07C2VZGJY%2CB08PB48DG8%2CB091PK96S1%2CB015TKUPIC%2CB08TQFHW1C%2CB07C2VH2MV%2CB096X5SS8X%2CB08XW34774%2CB08MTJFGDW%2CB0928VN98C%2CB08XTT6DQ3%2CB002UXRXEG"
5,Love Love Love,2021/5/22,"This battery starter is amazing! My 2009 BMW was completely dead. Anyone who has a BMW knows it is not easy to get into since the battery is in the trunk. I used the Hulkman immediately after opening. I charged it for 3 minutes to 100% (yes, it's that fast), hooked it up using the positive and negative in the hood and within seconds the car started! I love it so much I am buying one for all of my cars and my elderly mothers' car. Thank you Hulkman! You saved me from wasting my time and sanity having to wait for roadside assistance."
5,"Simple set up, seems to be reliable",2021/12/9,I’ve used this twice since I got it.  The first time was less than 80% right out of the box and it started a completely dead minivan.  The next day I tried it again (battery dead the next day) with the charge around 65% and it didn’t work. Did a quick recharge of the unit (maybe 30 min) and it boosted the battery in a minute or two. Very compact even with the various accessories. I wish it came with a storage bag but that’s a minor detail. Very pleased!
5,OMG!  It Works!!!,2021/7/1,"Had a 2002 Mustang that wasn't started nor driven for 6 months!  IT WAS DEAD!  Ordered on Amazon and got it before 4pm next day.  Made sure the charger was fully charged and headed to the garage with a neighbor.  The flashlight was handy to clearly see what we were doing.  It's handy that you have a bright, dimmer, strobe, SOS, and flashing red light settings.  Attached the clamps to charger and terminals.  Then, turned the key.  VOILA!  Car started and I went for a ride.  Worked perfectly!  My only alternative was position second car, manually move the Mustang out of the garage, and use the jumper cables.  This is so easy you can charge the battery without another car.  Comes with wall plug, car plug and usb cable.  It will also charge your phone or tablet."
5,A must have for every car,2021/9/25,"We recently had a dead battery and the guy from AAA brought this. I could not believe how easy it was to start the car. My husband has always feared jumper cables and he cannot stop talking about this. No one wants to depend on another vehicle to jump a car or having the car in the garage trying to do it. It came 83% charged and only took minutes to get to 100%. It has a USB charger, car charger, and wall charger! We will order a second one!"
5,Extraordinary,2021/10/20,"I bought it a few months ago, charged the unit to 100% and I have it stored in my car, last week and by chance two friends of mine had problems with their batteries, the first Ford V8 5.4 triton with a fully discharged battery, it turned on instantly , the second a Ford fusion V6 3.0, I started it easier with 72% of the Hulkman charge, very satisfied with the purchase, but most importantly, when I put it to charge again I accidentally dropped it and the wall charger broke , I contacted Hulkman customer service how I could buy a replacement, what a surprise they sent me another wall charger on the third day it was at my door, that is, the product and the customer service is excellent, I recommend it with 6 stars if I could."
5,awesome,2022/3/26,"I must say I was shocked on how well and fast this product works. my first time using it I was disappointed but only because I wasn't using it properly.  when jumping a dead battery u must hold both buttons down for a couple seconds until you see READY. I'm one satisfied customer , this is a must have.  small and easy to transport.  I can go on and on but don't wanna sound as if I'm the seller.  lol"
4,What no case? REALLY?,2021/11/11,"Everything about this product rings high quality !
But when I opened it all up and found no carrying case, not even a cheap cloth bag to throw all the parts in, I was irritated! But then I looked , and they sell a wonderful case for $35!
(They do sell a bundled package with the case I would’ve purchased had I known )
I didn’t even see the bundled package until I got the product and started looking for a case!
Nothing in the ad for the device tells you there isn’t a case sent with it.
Seriously , WHAT do you purchase these days, with a half dozen small components that doesn’t include at least a cloth bag or something to keep the parts in ?
This was a money saving decision made in a conference room by people who should be fired!
As much as I like the product , I’m sorry this experience has been just irritating so far."
5,This thing has muscle!,2022/3/5,I am a professional auto tech and needed a jump box. I didnt feel like hausing a traditional big heavy jump box and so I purchased the hulkman alpha 85. So far I've only had occasion to use it once on a Hemi with a dead battery. This thing made the motor turn over faster than the car battery could! The recharging of the pack is pretty fast and it is very easy to use. Highly recommend!
5,Very easy,2021/11/10,"I am a complete idiot when it comes to cars, so when I told my husband bought this he was very amused. Truthfully I agreed with him, but I figured if I couldn't use it I could alway call AAA.

When I couldn't get my car started in a parking lot today, surprisingly I was able to connect the device and get myself to the service station no help. (PS, I just bought a second one for my husband!)."
5,Premium Product,2020/12/18,"I was very surprised with this product for the price. I was considering a similar but more expensive alternative in store but decided to go with this instead. It came with high quality packaging and premium feel. Came with the adapters seen in the image and the led lights are also red.

I used this product to jumpstart my fully dead car and had to use the manual mode. It started first try. It used about 8% of the battery and then took about 3 minutes to charge back to 100. Overall this is a would recommend"
5,"Quick charging, easy to use",2021/11/2,"The device is easy to use and I know virtually nothing about cars and have always been nervous about traditional jump starting and accidentally switching cables. I love the built in safety features. My dog stepped on the hazard light switch getting out of the car (she’s a repeat offender) and I didn’t notice. My battery was completely dead and I had to use force start mode, and it started right up."
4,"Works good, not perfect.",2021/10/21,"This worked great when hooked strait to cable(no battery). Fired the 5.7 hemi right up.

I gave it a five star for the fact, it did crank over my 6.0. But It could not start it. I think in a low battery situation it would start it time will tell. I think I'll keep this in my dodge and possibly get the one rated for 7.3 diesel and try that."
5,Best jump pack I have ever owned!,2022/1/19,"I have used this pack probably 12 times on one charge. If the battery is super dead all you need to do is hold both buttons down to force power from the pack to the battery. Only thing is i wish they would have included a storage bag to put all cables together.

I have purchased 4 to keep in all of the company trucks we have."
5,Will Start A COMPLETELY Dead Car Battery,2021/11/9,"Car had sat for six months.  Tried to do a slow charge with my cheap charger but remaining voltage on the baterry was zero.  Ordered this puppy, followed the directions and it cranked up the first time.  I let it run at idle in the driveway (which I later found out that that's like peeing in the wind), turned it off and the engine wouldn't turn over.  Jumpstarted it again, rode around to 45 minutes, pulled in the drive and hooked up the slow charger and let it run overnite. Went out the next morning and sure enough it wouldn't turn over.  Called AAA and had a new battery installed (they actually have the best prices).  I'll be sending this back because I no longer need it but not before I try it out on my wife's toes while she's asleep tonight.  Postive? Negative? Does it matter?"
5,Operates as advertised,2021/9/30,"We arrived home from a vacation and found the battery in our car died, I then connected the Hulkman A85, the display said Ready
I went into our car and it started up immediately.
Also it can be used to charge your Smart Phone and other devices.
I would recommend this product."
5,Charges FAST and Does the Job,2021/12/1,"After being quoted $225 for a jump and finally paying $75 for another tow company, I decided never again. I hit the road with jump starter and air compressor. This item was out of the box, fully charged and started my car in less than 10 mins. It arrived 80% charged with clear indicator....charged in 5 mins to 100% and said READY once I had connected the leads to my battery...What more do you want? Portable, reliable....it gives you a percentage count down as you use it of the amount of charge left. Nice compact tool. Very happy with the price and flexibility of this item."
5,"Just perfect for the job. No case included, not a problem!",2021/6/18," Great car battery jumper.
I recommend the rugged DeWalt 10 compartment organizer for it. Fits like a glove.... $12 at the Depot. And it's waterproof!"
5,"Great Unit, just wish it came with a carrying case.",2021/11/9,"Overall, fantastic build quality, USB-C integration, and very fast charging with the wall charger. Will double as an external battery for charging devices in a pinch, and has a reasonably powerful flashlight as well as SOS type light.

Definitely will do the job and jump any car with a dead battery, assuming your alternator is functioning and the battery is indeed the issue.

My only knock on the product is it doesn't come with a carrying case. I just threw it in my ""emergency toolkit"" Milwaukee bag. A nice case would make a big difference."
5,Very good,2021/6/13,"Easy to use, compact and works everytime. I never leave home without it in my trunk along with a few other items. Very nicely engineered product, go for it without second thoughts if you're in the market looking for an emergency jump start kit."
5,This thing is awesome!!,2021/11/15,"I've now had to use this jumper on 3 vehicles. 1 being a high torque engine the other 2 stock motors. It's still has a charge spins the engine's as if they had full charge batteries. The jumper I had originally used was a heavy much older battery box that after fifteen years and about 4 replacement batteries was finally dead and completely shot. This lightweight jumper had me very skeptical but wow its an encredible jumper definitely hope it will last awhile, we will see but so far it's a great product."
5,Solid,2021/2/6,"Product arrived on time and in good condition. Packaged well. Appears very well made.
Took it's first charge very quickly. Arrived with 67%, plugged it in and it went to 100% in just a few minutes.
Will follow up if/when it is called on to perform."
5,Really nice.,2020/12/2,"Really nice, The big display is great when you need it - and packs a punch.  No need to look around for a little tiny display in the middle of the night."
5,Amazing,2021/12/22,This thing works flawlessly...works the first try and the fact that it takes USB C makes it even better..cannot recommend enough
5,Started My SUV Twice,2021/9/7,"The battery in my 2018 SUV died while it was parked in my garage.  My jumper cables couldn’t reach my other car, so I bought this on Amazon (delivered a day late).  Charged up the thing, connected it to my car’s battery, and it started right up.  Had to use it again the next day. Nice to have around."
5,Well made and easy to use,2021/8/9,I have had this jump starter for a while and was going to wait until I used it to review it but that could be a long ways down the road from now so I will just give my initial impressions. It seems to be well made and the cables and clamps are good quality. I like the digital readout. I have watched several Youtube videos on this item and it works very well. The only negative I have about it is that it doesn't come with a case. I ended up buying a case on Amazon by Caseling made for the Noco GB70 jumpstarter and it fits great in it.
5,If you need a jump starter and won't settle for a cheaply made one,2021/9/2,"It's definitely more expensive than the average jump starter but for someone who appreciates finer things in life, this one stands above the crowd.

The packaging makes you think you just got a new iPhone.
The starter and all the accessories look and feel like solid quality products.
I love the large LCD screen for readout.
It charges from 83% to 100% in minutes after I opened the box.
The manual says it's good for 18 months after every full charge."
5,BEST BUY On AMAZON,2021/10/19,I have an older vehicle 06 accord with 275k miles. It usually dies if I don’t start her once every 2 days. I’ve used this jump starter at least 4x and it still doesn’t need a recharge. My Accord has. A V6 engine. And this beats every portable battery jump starter I’ve ever had.
5,Easy to use holds charge for months always ready for when you might need it.,2021/5/31,Haven't had to use it to jump a car battery but I used it to power my tire inflator and put all 4 tires to proper psi in minutes! No hassle no errors and still had 96% batt afterward... So far so good glad I made the purchase! Would definitely recommend!
5,Fixed are heater to??🥳 magical product,2021/2/17,"This was a true gift to our car, were always having to jump it and it took 2 min to go from 75% to 100% when we hooked it up the car started right away and took only 3% BONUS are heater was broken but after jumping the car it is now working and blowing hot air☺️🤩🥳 so it fixed the heater to👍 magical jumper"
5,Very good,2021/11/7,"Just received this today. Plugged it in to charge and it was already at 77% and took only a few minutes to get it to 100%. Took it outside and connected it to the car battery which had been very dead the day before and just a second after I put the jumpers on it said ready already. I thought damn, that's fast. Got in the car and turned the key and it cranked and started as though it had a new battery in it. I'm impressed, works better than I expected."
4,Great working product but no carring case to carry the loose bits!,2021/11/22,"I am really happy at how great this product works! I have an 2011 MB E500 that needs the amps to start and this product works perfect and only takes it down 10%. However they include no carrying case or bag for all the loose bits like the USB cable, jumper clamps, or charging cable! With everything being able to be unplugged from the main unit you would think they would have included something to carry everything. I can see parts getting lost and having to find someway to replace them."
5,"As Gomer says, SURPRISE SURPRISE",2022/5/25,"My buddy has a jeep that was parked for years. Just to test it, I told him to try it. Well, it jumped the jeep 5 to six times. Now my buddy is getting one. I'm ticked though. He gets his for 40 dollars less than I paid."
5,Top noch Quality. Very happy. (From Noco Owner),2021/8/14,"This is my opinion only. I am no expert but do buy alot of quality products. I have a Noco in one og my cars and used twice successfully. I wanted another Noco because of the quality but ended up trying this one. I was very impressed with the box and actual device quality and added cables (UsbC, super wall charger and car charger). Quality is same or better. I haven’t tried yet but quality is TOP. I got the bundle with case and am happy. If you are spending over 100 on this don’t go cheap on another case. Buy the original. Really glad I chose this one. Hope it lasts me years of use."
5,Best Purchase this single middle aged woman ever bought,2021/8/12,"I was scared to use this because I don't know how to use jumper cables. This is SO easy to use. It came charged to 88% capacity. You just plug it in to charge it. My car was completely dead. I attached the clamps and the unit registered 0% battery. I pushed to ""quick charge"" button, and my car started right up! SO easy to use. Light and very portable. It has ports to charge phone, tablets, etc., as well. ALL my friends are getting this for Christmas this year!"
5,Jump starter,2021/9/20,Used first time worked great. Went to start today car would not start. Charger would not work. Talked to Gary at Hillman told me how to reset.works great.  Hillman will work you through.  Thanks gary
5,Great jumper battery,2020/12/19,The Hulkman is a great jumper battery and can also be used as a battery back. It charges very quickly with the attachment it comes with. I really like the larger size display. It beats the 4 bars all the other jumper battery brands have. Built well and I highly recommend it.
5,I was excited to put this review! This product seemed awesome,2021/10/8,"Ok I have not used this for jumping any car, I just got it but you can tell outright based on the packaging that this product is gonna be solid. Let me start with the build of the product, I got mine with 70% charge and the whole item feels solid and well built. I hope I don’t get to use it , but for emergency I wouldn’t wanna take any chances."
5,"Easy to use, worked on a F150 no problem.",2020/12/28,"The jump starter was incredibly easy to use. Charged it up out of the box and have used it to start a pickup, a small 4 wheeler, a tractor, and a lawn mower already. Great gadget to keep in the truck with you as you'll never know when you might need it. Will be carrying it with me into the boat too!"
5,Great quality,2020/12/9,"I saw this on Rich Rebuilds and compared it to other portably jump starters. Great power/capacity, easy to use with big screen and clear graphics/instructions. Just needs a carry case instead of keeping it in the box."
5,And the winner is!!!,2021/9/25,"Excellent choice after searching all other similar products, you can't go wrong on this one. The quality is there, no short cuts on production on this! At the outset of unpacking i knew i was getting something of value. I haven't used them yet but I don't doubt it will do the job."
5,YOU NEED THIS!!!!,2022/1/12,"Had this in my truck in the storage compartment.  One afternoon my coworkers truck wouldn't start ( Silverado 1500 ). Connected this little gadget and within a FEW seconds,  BOOM........his truck cranked right up!! Would definitely recommend to anyone.  Never know when you'll have the opportunity to help someone out."
1,Will not connect to battery cables.,2021/12/11,Will not connect to battery cables.  I’m unable to connect the cable for the battery posts into the unit. I realize there’s two ways to insert and that you had the lineup the square peg which I did. Still doesn’t plug-in so I’m returning it. Very disappointed.
5,It works!!!,2021/8/14,"I've had other battery jump starters that can't hold a candle to the Hulkman. My battery was completely dead. Hooked up jump starter, had my daughter start car while I held down both buttons. Within a few seconds car started right up. Highly recommend this unit."
5,Whatabeast!,2021/10/24,I needed to replace a smaller unit that the batteries were starting to swell. Saw this Hulkman on Daily Deals that seem to fit the bill. WOW!! I've only used it a few times but it has started all almost instantly! I'm sure they have made a few more sales just from me jump-starting cars at work.
5,Works great! Override function is a must need for super dead batteries.,2021/5/4,"Worked great! Battery was on its last leg but needed a jump to get a new battery. I hooked it up to f550 v8 got an error 2 code which meant it needed to use the override function since the battery was too low. Pressed the two buttons and it was like a shock paddle, the truck light up instantly and started instantly. Best part it didn’t drain the whole thing only to 90%."
5,It works great,2022/2/7,Easy to follow directions …. Started  and charged my 2011 Cadillac SRX . The car has an electrical issue - battery can go dead without any warning - no one has been able to locate the problem.  The battery & alternator are fairly new.  I keep the Hulkman unit charged at all times - it travels with me whenever/wherever I go. It gives me great piece of mind.
5,Reliable and accurate performer,2022/3/6,"This Hulkman product has been a reliable product for the 5 times or so I've jumped my vehicle or others. The size of this equipment makes for easy storage, transportation, and utility when setting on your vehicle and jumpstarting/charging. If for some reason the device doesn't let you jumpstart based on the voltage, hold the two buttons and it'll be placed in overdrive mode, which will allow for a jump. Great product, will continue to use and abuse this on my worn-down Jeep Cherokee."
5,So awesome!,2021/9/9,"This thing is amazing! I’ve been meaning to get one for a while now, and finally saw a deal on this one and snagged it. This thing charges fast and starts the car immediately! What a lifesaver. We will always pack this thing for road trips now."
5,Must have,2022/4/9,Probably the most important item I've ever bought on here and i spend thousands of dollars here 😂.. definitely an essential item and can also be used for other purposes. 10/10
5,Very satisfied,2021/8/21,"I've been using this at least 3 times a week and its never failed me. Jumped numerous vehicles with various sizes of engines. Also been using it for charging cellphones, tablets, laptops, rechargable camp lights just to name a few things. You can not go wrong getting this so small/light weight it's amazing what you can do with this. A GREAT BUY!!"
5,This thing is a life saver,2022/2/5,"Originally bought this for my bike, just in case. But I've ended up using this to charge my phone too. It's amazing. I've only had to use it once since I bought this to jump my bike. It worked like a charm no issues."
5,Great battery booster,2021/10/10,Just had to use it last night and it worked perfectly.  Once connected it told me it was ready (digital display) and the car I was boosting started right up.  This is a must for automobile drivers.
5,Finally a good jumper!,2022/3/26,After owning a couple cheaper units that were starting maybe half of the cars at my work I decided to pay a little more for this one and voila it has started every car I have attached it to with no problem. It’s great!
5,Unbelievable!,2021/8/12,"Have used this to jump start my 4.4 Range Rover HSE for a week and a half, and still has 50% charge. My Rover has a parasitic draw from a bad final stage resistor in a/c system that kills battery in about 6 hours. Haven't been able to repair due to work schedule, and the Hulkman has saved me, jump starting my Rover twice a day for ten days, with power to spare. Outstanding job Hulkman."
5,Simplicity is key,2021/5/7,I have a few other jump starter units as I was an early adopter.  This is by far the simplest design and ease of use.  The large display makes it very clear on charge level and when it is ready to jump.  I bought the case which is a nice design to store and heavy duty.  I would like to see the case and the jumper as one purchase which would make this the best deal on Amazon.
5,This product really delivered!,2021/11/16,This was able to get my car started even when my mechanic's booster pac failed! I'm definately getting another one.
5,Just what I needed,2022/3/14,"Was tired of carrying my old style jump box, it finally died. This jump box system, will even jump my bigger diesel tractors, unlike the old style jump box I had.. Love it"
5,Master piece,2021/9/16,"Totally recommend this. It perfectly works. Left my car ford focus 2015 running overnight, don't ask me why, and it was out of gas and out of batter the day after. It was the reason I took a shot and bought this. Fully Charged this hulkman up within an hour from ~60% to 100%. Jumped start my car with the dead battery and it only used 5% (95% left). It has other cables and USB C for charnging other things too. Perfect for camping. Love it so much."
5,Read the instructions,2022/1/29,"Easy to use and does a great job of starting a dead battery on a Scion.  I bought a case for it and it does great.  Zipper operates smooth.  Oh, a case does not come with it."
5,Hulkman is a Hulk.,2022/3/10,"Works as advertised. This product rocks. The only shortcoming is that it doesn’t include a case. Looking online at hulkman for the case, they want another $35 for it. F that."
5,Charge Up,2022/3/24,A unique portable battery charger that fits well in my trucks cab. So far have not used it but it's always a wise course to invest on emergency items for the unexpected.
5,EC5 Connector!!,2021/11/3,"One of the main reasons I got this was to be able to jump my electric start only KTM dirt/snowbike. Did quite a bit of research then verified that this jump pack utilizes an EC5 female connection for the jumper cable attachment. I was able to order a 10 AWG non-fused ring terminal to SAE adapter, SAE polarity changer, and a 10 AWG SAE to Male EC5, to make this the ultimate jump pack at a much more reasonable price.  Works very well and lasts a long time, only downside is it’s size and weight compared to more expensive models."
1,Useless,2021/8/9,Useless tried to jump my car battery and didn't even work not even a soark
5,Awesome!,2021/9/28,I used this little jumper to start a truck with a dead-no charge battery and it jumped it right up... very fine product so far... this gets used once a day at least and as long as it's got 75% or better it'll work miracles the big jump packs can't...
5,Great to have just in case,2021/9/1,I ordered one of these a few months ago and just got to use it for the first time tonight. It was super easy to use and worked great! I will always make sure to keep it charged and in my car just in case
4,Solid atter Starter,2021/10/17,The device has worked very well for me the past few months as I have several mowers and power tools that the batter is bad on so this allows me to just jump start the batter and get moving.
5,This thing rocks,2022/3/21,"The HULKMAN chages easily and last quite a long time, I have jumped 3 cars and still 89%!"
5,Perfect for College Student,2021/11/30,"This has been a lifesaver for my daughter while away at school. Sometimes she goes weeks without driving her vehicle and it will need a jump. Now instead of finding someone to jump her, she pulls this out, connects it, hits 2 buttons and bam... car starts! With winter approaching I'm guessing she will get plenty of use out of this! I would recommend this!"
5,Must have for your car!,2021/1/25,Loved it. Quick and easy to use. Used it on numerous cars as well and used it 7 times on my car alone (apparently software update was causing the drainage in my battery). The device is still holding up charge. Best investment. Should be in everyone’s emergency car kit.
5,Worked great,2021/11/29,This thing is super easy to use.  It was easily able to jump my SUV.  Super easy visuals make it very user friendly.
4,As advertised,2020/12/18,Soild kit.  Works as advertised as a jump starter.  I thought I would use it more for small electronics charging but it’s just to big to pack around on your person - maybe this will change when outdoor/camping season starts.  my main concern is longevity since it’s a new company and new tech - time will tell
5,Hulkman delivered as specified,2021/7/5,"Hello, the Hulkman is everything as specified, happy I chose the it, I will definitely recommend
to family or friend. Just need to purchase the carry case to make my purchase complete."
5,Excellent,2022/3/19,"This battery has already started my car several times. It does so effortlessly and reliably.

Nice"

5,Get this now!,2021/9/4,"I left a light on in the car. My bad. My screw up. This amazing device showed up. Already powered to 80% and up to 100% in 15 minutes. It worked first time. Did an amazing job.

But this now and store in your glove box. Simple. Easy to use. Perfect."
5,Should be a great backup,2021/9/15,It charges fast for sure. Fortunately I have not had to use it. But it looks and feels great. I have it on my boat as backup
5,1st Grade Quality,2021/9/9,"This jump starter is even better than I expected, works perfectly and looks extremely well made. Highly recommend it"
5,Extreme Quality,2021/11/9,"This is probably the best quality product I have seen, just outstanding.  Great display, cable wire jacket is that soft rubbery coating and not that hard plastic outer jacket and this goes for all the cables, even down to the supplied USB cable and the 12v socket adapter cable.  Nice, big and stout unit.  AC Power supply for quick charging is massive and charges battery incredibility fast.  It is a great product."
5,Awesome Product,2021/6/22,This works great!  I had to use this on my boat out on the lake when my battery ran down trying to start my outboard.  It provided the power to get me going.  I keep it in whatever vehicle I'm driving just in case.
5,Gift for him,2020/12/15,This is a gift for my husband.  He was very excited for this item.  It is sturdy and appears to do everything that he expected it to do.
5,Great Product!!!,2022/3/18,"Fiancé loves it, has used it many times already to connect to tire air pump. So compact & lightweight & battery last a long time. He’s just ready to jump if anyone needs help :) Very handy product!!!"
5,It really works!,2022/4/26,"It came with 75% charge but charged it up to 100%. Used it about 5 times, it worked almost instantly on a completely dead battery. That was about two months ago, still has 85% charge, best thing I bought so far."
5,Great 👍🏻,2022/4/16,"great ! I received it today, it looks great, I hope it works as I have seen in the reviews, I am happy with the product.  Very fast delivery, impressed.  thank you"

4,No case!,2021/11/26,"Product is fine, disappointed it comes without a case to hold main battery and accessories."
5,So Fast And Easy,2021/9/30,"I don't usually review stuff but I was so impressed how well this worked. Pros:
- It is very simple to use. Much faster than hooking up the cables to my car.
- It comes with all the cables you need. The actual cables for attaching to the car battery seem high quality.
- It charges very fast.
- Big screen to tell you the batter percentage, if its ready to jump and if its charging.
- Its pretty small and lightweight. I was surprised when it actually worked!"
5,Great Product! Totally drained car battery - Alpha 85 - Vehicle started immediately.,2021/9/10,"Using this for the first time, my battery was completely drained, but I needed an immediate start (2006 Town and Country). I quickly looked up the instructions, put the battery into a form of direct power mode, and my vehicle started instantly. Awesome product.

Helpful Note: Make sure to read the user manual, so you'll understand what the indicator icons stand for - that will improve your overall experience, especially first impressions."
5,Powerful yet compact,2021/8/23,Small enough to carry in my saddle bags (2011 SG) yet powerful enough to jump start a full size diesel truck 6.0 ~ so far I would recommend this product it's worth every dollar sent on it.
5,Love 2 kick start,2022/1/20,Luck has it as I've not needed yet Totally impressed from the packaging to the end product
5,Lifesaver!,2022/1/12,"Simple to use, portable, great for not needing another car and more compact than jumper cables."
4,Easy to use,2021/7/16,I turned the light on overnight for my car and the next morning it wouldn't start. I was very lucky to have this ready to jump start or else I would have been late to work. Ever since then I always carry this in the trunk. Saved the day.

5,Jump-starter is perfect,2021/5/5,"Very good type of jumper starter using it a lot to jumpstart our Prius that the battery dies on it a lot. I even use it as a power bank to charge my own electronics and it works very well as a jumpstarts to quickly jumpstart and a power bank. Plus, when this jumpstarts is low on battery it charges to 100 percent really quickly. Definitely recommend this"

5,Convenient,2021/5/26,"My boyfriend has a breathalyzer In his car, so his car dies every other day. It's great to use in a rush before having to get to work, or if it dies after. Its great not to have to he home to jump his car, or have to take him to work if he isn't ready in enough time for a 15 minute jump."
5,Very good for the money,2022/4/15,This thing jump started a 5.2L Ford engine that the battery was completely dead with ease.

My car sat in the garage for a week due to the arctic snow storm we had in Arkansas in mid February and was completely dead when I went to start it.  The Hulkman jumped the car off with ease with a boost.  And it charges back to 100% in no time.  What a great purchase!
5,Seem like a good purchase,2021/12/13,So far this charger has been amazing. I have nothing but good things to say about this charger. I don't know how well it will last or will any hiccups occur. But so far it's a good purchase.
